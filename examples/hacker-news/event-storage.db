I wouldn’t say they were anywhere near frequent enough to take a preventative drug for it.<p>These two sentences contradict each other. If you never had to consider taking a preventative for your migraines, then no, you do <i>not</i> know how bad they can be. Migraines are much more than just &quot;ow my head hurts today, I should take the day easy&quot;. For some, they are debilitating to the point of sometimes making it impossible to do basic tasks like washing the dishes, reading, or sometimes even watching TV. Sometimes during a migraine you literally cannot do <i>anything</i> other than sit in darkness and wallow in misery, hoping that maybe it will ease up for long enough for you to fall asleep. Any kind of professional work is out of the question during a migraine.<p>Not getting a migraine while <i>at</i> work isn&#x27;t uncommon, as sometimes having something to focus on (like work) can help stave off whatever triggers the migraines. Migraines also aren&#x27;t something that just suddenly happens; people who suffer from chronic migraines often get warning signs that one is coming on 12-24 hours in advance, and they can take just as long to develop as well. If someone was already at work, it&#x27;s unlikely that a migraine would progress to the point of being debilitating before the workday was over. This is probably why your coworkers usually call in sick, but never leave in the middle of the workday. They typically will know before the workday even begins if it will be a migraine-filled day or not.<p>Chronic migraines can lead to depression, which can cause a downward spiral of deteriorating health&#x2F;diet, which can in turn cause more migraines, and more depression. Often time migraines can lead to thoughts of suicide because of how badly it hurts, and how badly it impacts life as a whole.<p>I understand it&#x27;s frustrating if your coworkers bail often, and shame on them if they are faking their &quot;migraines&quot; and just using it as an excuse. But as someone who has an SO who suffers from severe migraines 15-20 days per month, and still forces herself to go to work most days <i>even through severe, debilitating pain and depression</i> precisely because she has coworkers with judgmental attitudes like yours, I find your analysis insulting.","commentId":"32ad205d-4b00-4df9-bfe1-770c90254823","parentId":"6b523269-b43d-492d-a258-342b992d8820"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"8607a42b-c0a4-452a-866b-d5b3068f3ce6:undefined","_id":"3Pd7mABJMwZtLXHx"}

This works even if the number your tracing isn&#x27;t on your network, but you need to have access to &quot;a&quot; network to do it. Lots of guys like SMS aggregators and small MVNOs have access to this.<p>If you have access to the network where the user is you can use either dedicated location systems if they have them or use the VLR method above for a rough location. If you wanted to get very fancy you could log into a system closer to the towers and check the reports on cell tower power that your phone periodically sends to triangulate better. Or even match them off coverage maps.<p>Under both systems above your phone is never party to comms (unlike actual SMS) so its impossible to know someone is tracing you..<p>This was 2G &#x2F; early 3G systems.

Note the extreme emotionalism that GDPR draws out of its supporters. That makes it difficult for some of the supporters to have a rational discussion when it comes to the flaws of GDPR. They don&#x27;t have a legitimate response to the context in question, so the easy approach is to attack the credibility of the person stating that they&#x27;ve struggled with compliance, rather than engaging in substantive discussion about the problems that GDPR generates for small businesses. The fear for the supporters is that if they admit to there being any flaws in GDPR, that will then act as a threat to GDPR (which they view as a monumental victory for privacy). They don&#x27;t want to give an inch of ground, no matter the issue, because they&#x27;re afraid of having GDPR diluted, taken away, and or not spread to the rest of the planet.<p>This is also why in all cases you&#x27;ll see the GDPR supporters go after the character of the site&#x2F;service owner (including always questioning their motives to muddy the waters).

But I do not believe that requires the need for profit-focused enterprises like Elsevier or the other publishing houses.  I don&#x27;t think any field has come up with a perfect solution yet, but as a computer scientist, things seem less grim than in many other disciplines of science.<p>I publish most of my research in the proceedings of the ACM conferences.  ACM is a professional association, not a for-profit enterprise.  Peer review is carried out by unpaid program committees, where I believe the primary motivation to participate is a combination of moral obligation, networking (with the other committee members), and an opportunity to get exposed to cutting-edge research.  This part is similar to other fields, I believe.  The main difference is that paper authors are expected to provide <i>camera-ready</i> PDFs of their paper, with the ACM doing little apart from proving LaTeX templates, concatenating the PDFs, and perhaps arranging a few print runs (but I think it&#x27;s been a while since I have seen physical proceedings).<p>Most ACM conferences (and journals) are not open access, but some are.  Generally it takes a subscription to their Digital Library to download the papers.  My impression is that this subscription is cheaper than for the large publishing houses, but I don&#x27;t know.  In any case, an author can pick various licensing models for their paper, with one of them permitting the author to provide a &quot;preprint&quot; of the paper on their personal or institutional website.  In practice, that means the papers are publicly available with minor effort, only that ACM does not take responsibility for the hosting.<p>The entire process appears quite lean, and the expenses incurred by ACM are covered through general membership and conference attendance charges.  Further, the ACM appears to continually (and rather aggressively) move towards even more open access-ish policies, likely because it is ultimately run by academics.<p>The main difference from arXiv is that pre-publication peer review does actually take place.","commentId":"684e197f-3844-4108-9b76-c1e05343fccd","parentId":"a7263b8d-dd4d-4ede-a1a4-e847162704e9"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"3ab3a03d-a63a-45a2-b863-5162e931da91:undefined","_id":"6TLlCtjqggcCLx1X"}

Various features of Python like dynamic typing and object&#x2F;class mutation (via del) preclude many static analysis techniques. In Cannoli, this meant that the compiler had to also generate code that manages scope at run time. Whenever an identifier was encountered in the compiled code a hashmap would be searched to find the bound value. This overhead becomes expensive, and the thesis covers optimizations that avoid this. PyPy&#x27;s JIT operates on the PyPy interpreter itself, finding linear lists of operations that are frequently used. It can then compile these operations to bytecode so the next time that trace is encountered it can execute the compiled code. The self-analysis at run time provides information that an AOT compiler just doesn&#x27;t have.<p>That being said, I did leave a few suggestions in the &quot;future work&quot; section that talk about writing an AOT compiler for RPython (the version of Python that PyPy&#x27;s interpreter is written in). This would provide more information at compile time and would be an interesting comparison between a Python interpreter compiled AOT versus a Python interpreter with a JIT (PyPy).","commentId":"69a79c74-405e-43ea-8604-9ce6900acef6","parentId":"1a0012d0-062d-4306-8303-9923765eb824"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"7605667c-de3a-495b-a14a-684f7c8db6a8:undefined","_id":"6m2dKy71c0SD5Q8v"}

I have a bunch of comments and questions.<p><i>&gt; The goal of the thesis was to evaluate language features of Python that were hypothesized to cause performance issues.</i><p>In another life I did something similar using a similar compiler simulation technique, looking at other Python features like redundant reference count operations, boxing of numbers, dynamic type checks etc. See G. Barany, Python Interpreter Performance Deconstructed. Dyla&#x27;14. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.complang.tuwien.ac.at&#x2F;gergo&#x2F;papers&#x2F;dyla14.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.complang.tuwien.ac.at&#x2F;gergo&#x2F;papers&#x2F;dyla14.pdf</a><p>After obtaining the numbers in that paper, the work didn&#x27;t really go anywhere; there were no really obvious optimizations to try based on the data. But it was fun!<p>Anyway, questions:<p>1. If I understand the source on GitHub correctly, you parse Python source code yourself. I&#x27;m fairly sure your simulation would be a lot more faithful if you compiled Python <i>bytecode</i> instead. Did you consider this, and if yes, was there a particular reason not to do it that way?<p>I ask this in particular because if I understand your thesis correctly, you look up local variables in hash tables every time they are referenced. This is <i>not</i> what Python does: It maps variable names to integer indices during compilation to bytecode, and the bytecode just takes those embedded constant indices and indexes into an array to obtain a local variable&#x27;s value. That&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> faster. And you would get it automatically if you started from bytecode. (Plus, it would be easier to parse, but if you have fun parsing stuff, that&#x27;s reasonable too.)<p>2. Where do you actually make useful use of Rust&#x27;s static ownership system? I&#x27;ve only skimmed that part of the thesis very quickly, but I missed how you track ownership in Python programs and can be sure that things don&#x27;t escape. Can you give an example of a Python program using dynamic allocation that your compiler maps to Rust with purely static ownership tracking and freeing of the memory when it&#x27;s no longer used?<p>3. Related to 2: Why bother with any notion of ownership at all? Did you try mapping everything to Rust&#x27;s reference counting and just letting it do its best? I&#x27;m wondering how much slower that would be. Python is also reference counted, after all, <i>and</i> I guess the Rust compiler should have more opportunities to optimize reference counting operations.<p>4. In general, do you have an idea why your code is slower than Python, besides the hash table variable lookup issue I mentioned above?","commentId":"02ee3260-1982-4801-9d14-d1216795f61b","parentId":"10caaad5-ae26-47d9-b45a-0546af420b33"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"7605667c-de3a-495b-a14a-684f7c8db6a8:undefined","_id":"8C4O2sBMwWj5rC8w"}

These dreams, I think, are a reflection of the way I think of my future-- kind of a way to resolve the map I have in my head of my trajectory.<p>Then I have dreams where it&#x27;s very clearly about the past. Usually steeped in mood (not necessarily emotion) and a sense of a cohesive &quot;theme&quot;, which really illustrates the fruits of introspective moments during waking time.<p>Then there are people who have dreams regularly filled with symbology, which is one of the common conceptions of what dreams are. Symbol dreams are rare for me, but I definitely pay attention when they happen.<p>Ultimately I think it comes down to abstractions. Maybe when you wake up in the morning try to figure out what your dreams were abstracting, and then you&#x27;ll notice a pattern. There are abstractions within the abstractions too.

Unlike a typical business (Axios called more than two dozen hair salons and restaurants), the employees who answered the phone in Google’s demos don’t identify the name of the business, or themselves. Nor is there any ambient noise in Google’s recordings, as one would expect in a hair salon or a restaurant. At no point in Google’s conversations with the businesses did the employees who answered the phone ask for the phone number or other contact information from the A.I. Further, California is a two-party consent state, meaning that both parties need to consent in order for a phone conversation to be legally recorded. Did Google seek the permission of these businesses before calling them for the purposes of the demo?

Basic reinforcement training techniques can be used for this; provide rewards for getting incremental work done, but better to provide them intermittently. Eventually work up from smaller rewards for smaller goals to larger rewards for larger goals.<p>I think that reinforcing consistency, habit, and small incremental progress rather than brilliance is a big part of what you need. The problem with brilliance is that you can easily get a lot of positive reinforcement for it; people are impressed at how well you understand something, at how much you know, at how quickly you pick it up. But even if you are better than average at picking things up and figuring things out, you will eventually hit the limits of what you can do through brilliance alone; there are some things that will just take long hard work no matter what, and then all of that reinforcement for brilliance comes back to bite you because you&#x27;re not getting the same kind of reinforcement, and you can easily get stuck and lose faith in your self-image.","commentId":"babfcab0-da21-496b-be0f-36f4a733e2d6","parentId":"40f32bd9-fd88-431d-ac2b-f048fcc37687"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"61a48d36-b104-404e-af45-89384f8535de:undefined","_id":"9mK1G3yOZQdeaZyY"}

A optimized JIT compiler is going to blow an AOT compiler out of the water. Being smart about the machine code generated is significantly more important than generating machine code.

For example, PyPy erases dictionary lookups for object member access if the object shape is statically known. Given how prevalent this kind of lookup is in Python code, it&#x27;s possible that even an interpreter that made this optimization would be faster than a machine code version that used an actual hash table.<p>I think this compiler also makes this particular optimization, but this is just one of many many optimizations PyPy does. I imagine that with sufficient work, this compiler could be brought up to speed with PyPy, but as it stands right now, PyPy simply benefits from having years of optimization work that a new project doesn&#x27;t.","commentId":"33da2f46-cf06-4bb9-844a-c6c408025b94","parentId":"1a0012d0-062d-4306-8303-9923765eb824"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"7605667c-de3a-495b-a14a-684f7c8db6a8:undefined","_id":"9ti8OxWPCSZ2L2VS"}

If it makes you feel awkward that I&#x27;m honest about who I am in writing, then yeah, our friendship is probably superficial at best, and in those cases, I&#x27;m not really concerned on your feelings about my feelings. Feel free to unfollow (I know I unfollow certain friends posts).<p>2. Blogs have been used for this sort of thing for a MUCH wider audience than a group of friends behind a gated digital community, and I&#x27;ve personally never had any kind of issue with reading people&#x27;s personal struggles, even other devs, and in fact it makes them far more human to me.<p>Then again, the type of vulnerability you&#x27;re thinking of may be different than mine, but either way, to each his own. :)<p>The rest of the behaviors you mentioned are pretty much why I generally don&#x27;t use Instagram or Twitter more than once every few months. Those formats, even when following devs, seem to encourage the types of activity you&#x27;re discussing at least in my feeds. But FB is probably the platform I curate the most, simply because most of the people I care about use it to share about their life, from milestones to quick takes, for the most part, without excessive narcissistic self aggrandizing posts (some do, but most are fairly harmless, otherwise after a while, I just choose not to follow).<p>But I&#x27;ve noticed that there are definitely preferences across the board, which is mainly why they all seem to stick around. I doubt there will be one social media platform to rule them all, the same way there&#x27;s no one amusement park or one kind of gym. There are behemoths, but there&#x27;s always a long tail, especially in socializing.","commentId":"19af54d1-327c-4b8c-8a42-7e9ad9999b36","parentId":"9a34f423-a774-41f4-93dc-1b525add7938"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"8f140ef1-9004-4324-adb5-352c3939568f:undefined","_id":"Dx7LSsnHmPQsNWEV"}

However, they lose the &quot;meta-game&quot; when animal control shows up and puts them down because they won&#x27;t go away.<p>The author uses this analogy to compare coyotes to financial innovators. His argument is that every time financial innovation gets out of control and the economy at large is impacted, larger powers step in and squash it. He argues tha this is what happened in the 2008 financial crisis with mortage backed securities, and that this is the same thing happening now with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.<p>I disagree with the parallel he draws to cryptocurrencies.<p>While I don&#x27;t necessarily think cryptocurrencies will dominate the world, and Governments may even succeed in reigning them in, they aren&#x27;t in the same category as other financial innovation.<p>Mortgage backed securites were the coyotes stalking across the laws of suburban moms, hoping animal control wouldn&#x27;t interfere.<p>Cryptocurrencies are a coordinated attack by a pack of coyotes on animal control headquarters.<p>They were designed specifically to be as government-resistant as possible. Now, animal control has a lot of firepower and they can call in reinforcements. Governments have a lot of resources and powers they can draw on to stop and regulate cryptocurrencies. However, these coyotes are well aware of the meta-game, who the true enemy is and they&#x27;re gunning hard for him.<p>Before bitcoin, no currency that wasn&#x27;t backed by a government lasted long before being shut down by a government entity. Bitcoin has been going for nine years now, and in that time further innovation has given us Monero and Zcash which are even more censorship and surveillance resistant.<p>The primary attack vector, the only one that&#x27;s worked, has been made by the &quot;racoons&quot; at Blockstream and their investors from Visa and the banking industry. This is a much more subtle attack than direct government intervention. In a nut-shell, when Satoshi left the project, he left a guy named Gavin Andresen in charge. Gavin trusted the wrong person with commit access to the project, who was co-opted by the banking industry and who then booted him from access. Thos current group of developers crippled Bitcoin by repeatedly refusing to expand the block size and moving forward developing the &quot;Lightning Network&quot; which is nothing more than a copy of the current inter-bank payment system and which, quite frankly doesn&#x27;t work.[1][2] They also took over the r&#x2F;bitcoin subreddit as well as the bitcointalk forum and completely censored it.[3]<p>The fact that the racoons have taken this more subtle approach, suggests to me that the enemies of Bitcoin now believe that attempts to shut it down by more direct mean will fail.<p>However there are still a lot of coyotes working on other cryptocurrency projects. These coyotes are clearly playing the meta-game, and for now they&#x27;re winning.<p>[1] Summary of what the lightning network is: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UYHFrf5ci_g\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UYHFrf5ci_g</a>\n[2] Discussion of a developer who tried to implement micropayments with lightning network, but had to switch because it did not work well: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ew2MWVtNAt0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ew2MWVtNAt0</a>\n[3] A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in &#x2F;r&#x2F;Bitcoin: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@johnblocke&#x2F;a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@johnblocke&#x2F;a-brief-and-incomplete-histor...</a>","commentId":"fff6cbdf-1650-4a44-8963-4f05bbf9bab5","parentId":"61a48d36-b104-404e-af45-89384f8535de"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"61a48d36-b104-404e-af45-89384f8535de:undefined","_id":"ESRHXPyXqij0sgND"}

The goal of the thesis was to evaluate language features of Python that were hypothesized to cause performance issues. Quantifying the cost of these features could be valuable to language designers moving forward. Some interesting results were observed when implementing compiler optimizations for Python. An average speedup of 51% was achieved across a number of benchmarks. The thesis paper is linked on the GitHub repo, I encourage you to read it!<p>This was also my first experience with Rust. The Rust community is absolutely fantastic and the documentation is great. I had very little trouble with the &quot;learning curve hell&quot; that I hear associated with the language. It was definitely a great choice for this work.<p>I also included PyPy in my validation section and &quot;WOW&quot;. It blew both Cannoli and CPython out of the water in performance.

The &quot;Compiling Python&quot; section of my thesis is pretty much an explanation of how I had to translate elements of Python into Rust <i>because of</i> the borrow checker. There were a couple tricks (like using closures for functions) to getting around compile-time borrow checking. Some situations required the use of Rc &amp; RefCell to provide multiple references to mutable data, this defers borrow checking to run time. So yes, the borrow checker got in the way. But I didn&#x27;t have to write a garbage collector because the automatic memory management was handled via Rust&#x27;s ownership rules (the caveat here is with cyclical references which would need to be tracked, this work was omitted for time).<p>It does complicate the generated code, I don&#x27;t know if Rust is the greatest intermediate representation. But I do think it was a better choice than C. Debugging the generated code was so great because of the detail that the Rust compiler displays for warnings&#x2F;errors.<p>I&#x27;d be interested in seeing how a Python interpreter written in Rust would compare to CPython, this would probably make use of more Rust optimizations (than trying to generate code).","commentId":"77533df5-5850-4e5f-a321-494da117914d","parentId":"8d3d3a4e-0905-48e0-b06c-39226bcd972f"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"7605667c-de3a-495b-a14a-684f7c8db6a8:undefined","_id":"HVD6P07fJmHDjKPo"}

If you make a mistake or are simply trying but not having a good time at it, you&#x27;re not automatically destroyed, put in jail, fined for billions of euros etc.<p>The GDPR is beneficial to everyone, except people with bad intentions or bad practises (like having big budgets for PR, Ads and the CEO but not for tech).<p>The GDPR for basic FOSS and other single-person software boils down to:<p>- Don&#x27;t capture data and not ask first\n- Don&#x27;t capture data and not tell\n- Don&#x27;t capture data and now show\n- Don&#x27;t capture data and not say where it is\n- Don&#x27;t capture data and not say who can access it\n- Generally, users should be able to CRUD their data\n- Delete data on request\n- Export data on request<p>Most of that is common sense and in most non-commercial services this is available anyway.\nYou can make it even simpler:<p>- Only CRUD when a user CRUDS and tell them that is what they are doing while they are doing it\n- Make sure the delete&#x2F;opt-out&#x2F;close account button actually works\n- Have a line somewhere saying &quot;i&#x27;m hosting this on platform XYZ in country ABC&quot;<p>Since you are likely going to build CRUD + delete account anyway, that&#x27;s a solved problem. Unsubscribe&#x2F;Delete account usually already exists, no problems there either. That leaves writing a few lines telling users where you are storing stuff and how to contact for issues.<p>Don&#x27;t forget: laws comparable to the GDPR were already in effect long before the EU came up with a EU-wide version. In the UK for example, you could ask a business to send an export of all the data they have on you via mail, and they were bound by law to comply. In the netherlands, if you store PII of people who are not your clients and send them mail&#x2F;spam&#x2F;offers, you get fined. Hell, they even had a more universal version where you aren&#x27;t allowed to put mail in someone&#x27;s mailbox unless it was addressed specifically to them, and there was one where you weren&#x27;t allowed to put any ads in if the mailbox was marked for that.

Some companies even consider shutting down their websites completely and - of all things - only using a Facebook page in the future. Hence, ironically we might very will see GDPR actually benefitting companies like Facebook at the detriment of small companies that consequently won&#x27;t have complete ownership of their content anymore.<p>- How exactly does a privacy policy have to be worded so I don&#x27;t get sued on day 1?<p>- In which way will I still be able to store address data for contacting my existing customers?<p>- Will I still be able to use anti-spam and security plugins for my website? These tools might store users&#x27; IP addresses, which in some jurisdictions are considered personal data.<p>- Can I still load resources like Google Fonts from CDNs or do I now have to host those myself?","commentId":"c3da4db7-11c7-48c4-9aba-c89f0ca80b3f","parentId":"0666631e-2d24-478a-a90f-266984e59c7c"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"0666631e-2d24-478a-a90f-266984e59c7c:undefined","_id":"IvZKeBQjqWm0VSqZ"}

I can read through it linearly. I can see how the variables are used to achieve the layout. The functions draw_title() and draw_big_text_button() have obvious meanings, partly because I can see x and y coords being passed in.<p>Comparatively, the code he ends up with is hard to understand. If I was new to the code, I&#x27;d be wondering what layout.window_title(title) does. I&#x27;d have to lookup the definitions of Panel_Layout data structure and window_title() function. Instead of reading linearly, I now have a tree traversal to do. That is harder.<p>However, he&#x27;s not wrong. The changes he made allow more things to be added to the UI panel without the code becoming an incomprehensible mess.<p>Let&#x27;s call the original code the linear one. I think the reason his refactoring is good is because the linear function would otherwise have passed a threshold where it was too complex to fit into the working memory of the programmer. The tree traversal exercise he is forcing the next programmer to do serves a purpose. Each function and data structure he introduced is small enough to fit in the programmer&#x27;s working memory. After looking up those definitions, their (simple) behaviour should be able to be parked in the programmer&#x27;s medium term memory. Once that investment is made, use of working memory is reduced, freeing up the possibility of adding more stuff to the UI panel function without it passing the threshold.<p>There&#x27;s a trade-off. In some ways he made the code worse. But it was necessary. We should always be asking ourselves if the abstractions we are introducing are necessary. Understanding the constraints of programmer&#x27;s brains is vital to being able to make that judgement.","commentId":"dc500f27-a5f9-4a61-b5d8-5ec172861c66","parentId":"5a05d982-2411-46b8-adb8-91f8c7ee1ca8"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"5a05d982-2411-46b8-adb8-91f8c7ee1ca8:undefined","_id":"KKFXd6MHWcciotzS"}

But because in our modern lives we don&#x27;t do the running away or fighting we don&#x27;t use up the cortisol and it just simmers away in us.<p>I don&#x27;t think it makes much sense to compare our modern concept of stress to very different times in the development of our society. Wild animals are in constant threat of being killed but I wouldn&#x27;t think it makes sense to imagine them as stressed. They just live in the moment in a very different way to us.<p>Maybe &#x27;stone-age&#x27; isn&#x27;t far enough in the past to be different enough to modern life in that way. Even if that is the case, humans are very adaptable, the way a modern city dweller feels if they get attacked isn&#x27;t necessarily the same way someone would feel who has experienced it many times.<p>I&#x27;ve had my own very small experience related to this. Just over a year ago I gave up my bricks and mortar home in the city and moved into a caravan. It was a wreck and I had to completely rebuild the interior and re-do the electrics and plumbing myself. I learned that my walls and windows provide no security - you could break into my home with your bare hands, with a hammer or axe it would be very easy. I carried a lot of fear in my head at first. In bed I&#x27;d be worrying that there&#x27;d be a gas explosion or fire because of something I&#x27;d done wrong. Once I found a couple of massive surly travellers eyeing up my solar panels, thinking I wasn&#x27;t around. I had to go out and show that I was around and confident and not a target. I&#x27;ve met all kinds of people and not grown up sheltered at all but these two carried a real heavy, violent air - for a good week or two I was expecting them to turn up in the night to try to rob me, it was very hard to get that thought out of my head, and then to sleep in basically an unprotected tin can with plastic windows. Now I stay on a farm hundreds of miles away from any friends or family, there&#x27;s no contract or notion of stability, if I fell out with the farmer I might have to leave immediately. I don&#x27;t drive and at times haven&#x27;t had enough money to pay to be towed somewhere else (work has been tricky... especially in winter when I&#x27;m trying to keep my laptop alive by solar, I&#x27;ve limited mobile data and it&#x27;s 0-5C indoors), so a few cross words and I could basically be instantly homeless. Shops are an hour walk away, once I put a foot wrong on a track which nobody (not even locals) walks along and instantly sunk up to my waist in thick, sucking sinking mud and genuinely felt I might die there. LOL.<p>The point I&#x27;m ramblingly trying to get around to making is that after a while, it just wasn&#x27;t sustainable to carry on feeling stressed and edgy. Or my tolerance went up, or something. Life just feels a lot more reactive than it used to, I want to say more real. Although I do have stresses and worries sometimes I don&#x27;t walk around feeling permanently stressed or scared, actually I love it - it was the best move I ever made in my life, I feel a vitality which I didn&#x27;t have before.<p>I&#x27;ve learned that the kind of stresses I have now are somehow easier to bear than the kind I used to have in my old life. I&#x27;d somehow rather fight off an intruder in the night than try to navigate a Kafka-esque phone menu system and be condescended to by a passive-agressive CSR. Cold is a feeling I can distract myself away from by writing some code or mending something, whereas receiving a bill with big red capital letters on it could negatively affect my state of mind for several days. When I&#x27;m standing over a pit emptying my reeking toilet I just compare it (favourably) to talking to a letting agent.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.health.harvard.edu&#x2F;staying-healthy&#x2F;understanding-the-stress-response\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.health.harvard.edu&#x2F;staying-healthy&#x2F;understanding...</a>","commentId":"eb720d9b-27ee-4d84-94f6-282fa542bf37","parentId":"d119dc37-1173-4c50-afec-dd5e703be98d"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"1c9c85b9-df6f-4f14-a844-4f50ca58e88d:undefined","_id":"LuWubEb19q6U0cNm"}

I definitely know people who in real-life are totally cool, but their social media presence makes me question why I ever liked them in the first place. Mostly I see a lot of:<p>1) very overt attention seeking for pretty lame things (like, pretty girls posting selfies of themselves doing nothing interesting, or dudes with gym photos, that kind of thing) \n2) Extremely broad and poorly thought out political rants \n3) sharing really vapid motivational quotes \n4) people being maybe a little too vulnerable to a very broad audience, to the point where it&#x27;s awkward. \n5) This one is the worst of all. People taking passive aggressive swipes at individuals by posting very vague status updates. I hate stuff like that.<p>I don&#x27;t think of myself as a super judgmental person, but whenever I get on facebook I spend half my time just thinking &quot;really?&quot; and then feeling kind of gross.","commentId":"9a34f423-a774-41f4-93dc-1b525add7938","parentId":"8f140ef1-9004-4324-adb5-352c3939568f"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"8f140ef1-9004-4324-adb5-352c3939568f:undefined","_id":"LyReYv74UDK8LsLS"}

The reliable tester group waited up to four times longer (12 min) than the unreliable tester group for the second marshmallow to appear.[11][12] The authors argue that this calls into question the original interpretation of self-control as the critical factor in children&#x27;s performance, since self-control should predict ability to wait, not strategic waiting when it makes sense.<p>but it sounds like the original experiment controlled for the trust factor so I don&#x27;t really think it shows that the original results were invalid.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;ve not done a huge amount of research into this so maybe take my opinions with a grain of salt or two.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stanford_marshmallow_experiment#Follow-up_studies\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stanford_marshmallow_experimen...</a>","commentId":"a400f280-148d-499a-a34a-50700594da8b","parentId":"46580217-a732-45db-a62a-ac6398bd6447"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"61a48d36-b104-404e-af45-89384f8535de:undefined","_id":"Ol15NP4RYa7KZ5hc"}

At least, I didn’t find participation to be productive, but rather ranking by popularity, momentum, and signals of the newsfeed’s algorithm.<p>Complex stuff, but I hope that’s a statement others can engage with as I’m genuinely curious about understanding the landscape by looking through other lenses.","commentId":"2ae09a42-cb2e-4edc-924b-1d3326edab4b","parentId":"144a6b84-2b6c-4b75-8185-166de0920c6b"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"144a6b84-2b6c-4b75-8185-166de0920c6b:undefined","_id":"PZxjxMfxNC8HpsUb"}

If you&#x27;re going to store latitude and longitude, you&#x27;ll want to do it with signed fixed-precision numbers. Four decimal places if you don&#x27;t care about accuracy too much plus up to 180 above and below zero. That means you&#x27;ll need 26 bits (25 bits to store the data plus one bit for sign), and that covers one half of latitude and longitude. You&#x27;d need 52 bits to store a full set of coordinates, and since we&#x27;re not barbarians we can round that up to a nice even 64 bits (I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything relevant you can store in 12 bits...maybe carrier ID?)<p>Then you need to identify what device it&#x27;s for, that&#x27;s another 32 bits if you&#x27;re being conservative. I&#x27;ll ignore timestamp, since you could infer that from the location in the data store (assuming you have nice even 30s intervals), but it would otherwise be a bonus 64 bits.<p>That&#x27;s 10TB, but also pretty useless because you&#x27;ve got a giant pile of u32s. If you were going to do this for real, you&#x27;d probably store the user&#x27;s location with full precision for the first sample, then simply have diffs with a precision that assumes, say, the device isn&#x27;t going to move faster than the speed of sound. The index is likely going to be pretty massive, and you&#x27;ll constantly be reindexing because you&#x27;re getting new data all the time (with a cardinality of 300M).<p>Even then, you&#x27;re probably looking at something that&#x27;s triple or quadruple that size. Let&#x27;s say 40TB. That&#x27;s only 14.6PB&#x2F;year, which is not unreasonable storage for the government. But then you need to consider other things:<p>- You&#x27;re ingesting 600M data points per minute. If you&#x27;re only getting the minimum (96bits&#x2F;user), that&#x27;s over 7GB&#x2F;s.<p>- But of course, it&#x27;s probably not in a binary format (in the article, it was JSON and XML). Make that 50GB&#x2F;s.<p>- Now you&#x27;re parsing XML and JSON. That&#x27;s not free when you&#x27;re parsing 600M documents&#x2F;minute. You&#x27;d likely have a pretty damn big server farm to ingest all this data.<p>- Your carriers need to be able to send that data to you, so they need to be equipped to (collectively) deliver 50GB&#x2F;s of encoded location data; not to mention be able to dump the latest record for every customer in their location database twice per minute.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t bet money that the government cares enough about every last device in the country to rig together such a big system only to keep track of where my grandmother&#x27;s Jitterbug is. It&#x27;s nonsensical to think that they couldn&#x27;t just send an API request to AT&amp;T or Verizon and be like &quot;Hey guys, where&#x27;s John Doe&#x27;s phone been in the last week?&quot; That&#x27;s almost certainly more practical and cost effective in every way.","commentId":"e04a2b66-0b49-4a13-8612-584db0973c15","parentId":"2db7d042-f338-4ef7-952a-71c0757ec655"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"fe4ea01a-e961-470c-9fe3-78bf99b64e18:undefined","_id":"PdI0x6k1V0SpHYLw"}

At any given time, multiple cell towers can hear your devices signal. In the rare event it’s just one, you still get a surprisingly accurate location due to a quirk of cell towers (there’s never just one antenna, except for small cells in places like subways, it’s usually three or more using sector panels). Given a 120° direction (or less) and a distance based on time of flight, you usually get within a few blocks in most cities, and that’s without factoring in triangulation or other more advanced localization techniques. One carrier (maybe more) has the ability to localize a person with a range of ten feet (not everywhere, but enough places to turn it into a product they sell), which is generally more accurate than AGPS.","commentId":"b4d56972-0376-435d-973c-b5846d28e06d","parentId":"f4f3bd9e-a38d-44ad-8d5a-87ee11ec9bda"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"fe4ea01a-e961-470c-9fe3-78bf99b64e18:undefined","_id":"PnMV1YsGGGJDhJhT"}

We collect data in our system.  We use that data for marketing under legitimate interest.  Sometimes marketing would like more analysis done on the data than we have time to implement.  They hear about some SaaS business that will take the data and give them a marketing plan (Yay! No work to do!).  They ask us to ship over all the data to the SaaS business.  Sometimes it&#x27;s a good idea because the SaaS business is legitimately providing an analysis service.  Almost all of the time the SaaS business is providing nothing beneficial and instead just scooping up personal data that they sell.  It&#x27;s difficult for us technical people to explain why we can&#x27;t just arbitrarily ship data over to some random SaaS.  With GDPR it will be much, much, much better.  Essentially I think it will shut down the fly by night operations that are just sucking data and offering nothing in return.  But on the flip side it will mean that these analysis operations will have to charge a reasonable fee for their services (instead of selling the data they collect).  This, in turn, will prompt the marketing people to have to do due diligence because they actually have to spend money out of their budget.  No more &quot;It&#x27;s free, so why not?&quot;<p>Similarly we sometimes get asked to incorporate silly things into our service because the marketing people think that it will create engagement.  Again, these are free SaaS businesses that are scooping up data and selling it.  Although I made up the cat emoji thing, it&#x27;s not that far off what we sometimes get asked to incorporate.  With GDPR, those businesses are going to have to charge for their services and that&#x27;s going to have to come out of our budget.  We don&#x27;t have to argue &quot;We&#x27;re not shipping our whole customer database over to a SaaS just so we can have cat emojis on the the system&quot;.  Similarly, it makes our systems simpler because if they <i>really</i> want cat emojis, we can implement them -- it&#x27;s just not &quot;free&quot; (it never was, but it&#x27;s hard to have that conversation sometimes).<p>I probably should have left the SaaS thing out of my explanation because it&#x27;s confusing and only slightly related to what I was talking about :-).

Time will tell. What will definitely not happen is that out of the blue you will be yanked from your bed in Paris or Barcelona because you decided to refuse a request for deletion.<p>&gt; The days of someone making something, putting it on the internet and offering it to the world seem to be over.<p>No, the days of harvesting data and building profiles without consent are over. You can make something just like you did last week and you can offer it to the world just fine. <i>Do</i> take care of your users data, be a good steward and try to do your best not to get hacked.<p>&gt;  do not have the resources to hire a Data Protection Officer (DPO) or EU Representative as required by GDPR.<p>The GDPR does not have this requirement for the kind of business the article writer has. No need to hire anybody. Pure nonsense.<p>&gt; Tracking crashes with Crashlytics introduces new issues because it is posted to Fabric from a user’s device,  IP addresses are in the logs this is  personally identifiable information  (PII).  Crashlytics  is GDPR compliant but the burden is on me to show  regulators that I am compliant points back to the need for DPO.<p>Having a DPA in place with Crashlytics takes care of this, that&#x27;s all the burden there is, in fact, Crashlytics most likely has a standard form for this because they will be entering into DPA&#x27;s with a lot of companies in the next couple of weeks&#x2F;months.<p>&gt; Even though no message traffic passes through Monal’s sever, registering for a push does make an HTTP call which logs a user’s IP and this  requires GDPR compliance.<p><i>Everything</i> you do requires GDPR compliance but not everything is impacted by the GDPR. In this case logging the IP is fine, and then when you&#x27;re done with the data you can get rid of it. No need to keep it indefinitely. And that simple trick: <i>remove data that you no longer need</i> is going to go a long way towards establishing GDPR compliance.<p>&gt; APNS push tokens are associated with devices which can be traced back to a user if combined with info on the originating XMPP server. Obviously, this is needed for a notification to be delivered to the right person. However,the fact that it can be combined to identify a person makes it PII.<p>So do not keep it longer than you need it.<p>&gt; I believe in privacy but I do not have the resources to meet the letter of the law for compliance especially with respect to retention and processing these tokens.<p>But he <i>does</i> have the time to write blog posts complaining about having to meet the letter of the law. That time would have been better spent actually reading the law and figuring out the impact.<p>&gt; Honestly, I do not know if XMPP federation is legal anymore in the EU with GDPR.<p>Of course it is.<p>&gt; EU user data is sent out of Europe constantly.<p>Indeed. And that won&#x27;t stop because of the GDPR.<p>&gt; GDPR is written such that a user cannot agree to a user agreement that gives up GDPR requirements it’s not a matter of saying you agree to X by using this service.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s the whole point. You can&#x27;t blackmail your users to opt-out of the law by virtue of withholding your product, which is a very very nasty way of trying to deal with a legal issue, rather than to face it head on and simply attempting to try to comply.<p>&gt; GDPR compliance is something the XSF is talking about right now.<p>Good to see not everybody has the same attitude.<p>The way I read it this person is not trying to limit their liability, they&#x27;re simply trying to pretend the law doesn&#x27;t exist, have come to the conclusion that that won&#x27;t fly and now blame the law for their laziness and negative attitude towards the privacy of their users in general.<p>If he <i>really</i> cared about the users privacy then he&#x27;d at least make a serious attempt.

Canadian laws, and treaties that Canada has signed on to comply with.<p>If you decide to sell a couch to someone in America, you have to comply with American tax laws, American import and customs laws, American consumer laws, American patent laws, American copyright laws, American trademark laws, and any other laws involved with doing a financial transaction with someone in America. The same logic applies for Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, South Korea, Japan, etc. Pretending otherwise is naive, and if you don&#x27;t believe me then try to sell something patented in America to an American.<p>The key question is what happens if you break those laws. In most cases you will be given a fine, and if you don&#x27;t pay then you will no longer be allowed to sell goods to consumers in that country. If you continue to break the law then you are probably breaking an international treaty on border control or customs, which means that you could be extradited or tried in your own country. Some of the laws I mentioned above are mediated through international agreements, but the fundamental point is that if you break their laws they can place sanctions against you to stop you from doing business with them.<p>Of course, for a couch business things would probably never reach that level. And for an internet business you probably would just be IP blocked or something similar.<p>&gt; No other country in the world can just make some &quot;arbitrary&quot; law that affects me. Unless my country agrees.<p>But it only affects you if you make the positive decision to do business with a country that has those laws. If you don&#x27;t decide to do that, then you don&#x27;t have to follow those laws (obviously). You can&#x27;t have it both ways though (the benefit of having access to a market without having to follow the laws of that market).<p>In the case of enforcement you&#x27;re right that they wouldn&#x27;t have the right to compel to you to pay a fine, but they can in theory place sanctions against you.

It takes trillions of collisions to collect enough data to make a discovery about a single particle, for example.<p>Interestingly, one way that computational resources have recently had an impact is with the GAIA astrometry survey mission. There&#x27;s a concept in optics of an image being &quot;diffraction limited&quot; meaning that there is a characteristic resolution limit for a particular wavelength of light and optical instrument size. Meaning that there isn&#x27;t an advantage to having pixels that are smaller than that limit, since you&#x27;ll just have a blurry blob that is smeared across multiple pixels anyway, you won&#x27;t actually be able to increase the resolution of what you can see. However, this isn&#x27;t entirely true. What actually happens is that the light from a point-like source is spread out over an area in a characteristic pattern called the &quot;point spread function&quot;. If you were to resolve a distant star over multiple pixels (beyond the diffraction resolution limit) then if you were able to model the point spread function to fit the data for those pixels you could potentially locate the position of the star to a precision that was higher than the diffraction limits of your optical assembly. And this is precisely what GAIA does. It uses a telescope that is much smaller than the Hubble but it has an enormous (gigapixel) CCD imager which enables it to map the point spread functions for huge numbers of stars simultaneously. Before the advent of ubiquitous high performance computing this wouldn&#x27;t have been possible.","commentId":"ebd2e348-6fe2-46d5-8a13-c37a7f7d64d3","parentId":"acdc96b2-b45a-4059-8e1f-2f5ae99ce632"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"47b73c1a-8bd9-4433-b23e-95ac8f228dc7:undefined","_id":"S48HjWAYeBsMNADv"}

My experience has been that they vary wildly in &quot;reasonableness&quot;. UK ICO is pretty OK, they want companies to succeed. France&#x27;s CNIL is a joke. Petty, spiteful and utterly inconsistent. I watched as a company worked closely with them to get their sign-off on a change to their terms of service and privacy policy. CNIL were happy to be involved and taken so seriously, they were satisfied with the changes and even praised them in private. After the company announced the change, some journalists saw an opportunity to make some noise and did so. CNIL then immediately changed their mind and dished out a fine, despite having previously agreed to it. What a farce.<p>That&#x27;s at the national level. I can give many examples of cases where the EU has been anything but reasonable.<p>The entire argument Jaques presents here boils down to his belief that everyone working in GDPR enforcement in the EU will not only be totally predictable and reasonable <i>today</i> but also going forward into the indefinite future.<p>As pointed out in the other thread, this belief is itself unreasonable, because the nature of the GDPR means that even in the unlikely even it&#x27;s true today, if in 10 years a new Commission arrives and changes their mind they can retroactively decide that things previously allowed were actually illegal. The GDPR says virtually nothing about anything so they&#x27;d certainly argue such a thing was merely a &quot;clarification&quot; and not a retroactive change to the law.<p>There are plenty of examples of governments doing this sort of thing over time, including the EU, like with Apple&#x27;s tax situation.

Securitization (and financialization in general) just takes big balls of intertwined risks and breaks them apart into little balls of (theoretically) consistent risk so that everyone can get the amount of risk they desire.<p>Imagine a company that has a single customer.  There&#x27;s a 50&#x2F;50 chance that the customer will pay.  If the customer pays then the company makes a ton of profit, if the customer doesn&#x27;t pay then the company goes out of business.<p>For the company, this is probably more risk than they want to take.  But there&#x27;s probably hedge fund out there who has enough money to survive the customer not paying and is willing to take that risk for a fee.

In exchange give us 40% of it right now&quot;.<p>And the company is happy because they have a 100% chance of staying in business.

In laboratory tests, rats who were given BCS3-L1 were conferred with a lifetime of protection against S. mutans. BCS3-L1 colonizes the mouth and produces a small amount of a lantibiotic, called MU1140, which allows it to out-compete S. mutans. Hillman suggested that treatment with BCS3-L1 in humans could also provide a lifetime of protection, or, at worst, require occasional re-applications. He stated that the treatment would be available in dentists&#x27; offices and &quot;will probably cost less than $100.&quot; The product was being developed by Oragenics, but was shelved in 2014, citing regulatory concerns and patent issues. In 2016, Oragenics received a 17-year patent for the product.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Caries_vaccine#Attempts_using_replacement_therapy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Caries_vaccine#Attempts_using_...</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newscientist.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;dn1941-gm-bacteria-may-banish-tooth-decay&#x2F;amp&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newscientist.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;dn1941-gm-bacteria-may-...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;m&#x2F;pubmed&#x2F;12369203&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;m&#x2F;pubmed&#x2F;12369203&#x2F;</a>","commentId":"5133211b-ca6c-4562-aa73-7293d2d925de","parentId":"4173c4ad-1386-45f6-bc59-737d04d6f3cc"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"1c9c85b9-df6f-4f14-a844-4f50ca58e88d:undefined","_id":"VwyKehmVHWIHXejO"}

I was born with optic nerve hypoplasia (and nystagmus in my right eye) but don&#x27;t recall EVER having any problem prior to this.<p>For years I went through the roundabout of doctors offering treatments that didn&#x27;t really help (Botox) or give unhelpful advice (&quot;just avoid triggers&quot;). It wasn&#x27;t a problem before this, dammit. I eventually dropped out of school, stopped using computers for days at a time and spent over 95% of my time for over 5 years sleeping being very depressed and suicidal.<p>It got to the point where my eyesight was degenerative and my doctor suggested I try topiramate (risk of optic nerve damage and my eyesight was already bad and getting worse by the day). I tried valproic acid and it made my vision blurry for a week, but I recovered upon stopping the drug.<p>In early 2017 I got a medical cannabis prescription from a doctor who acknowledged that other treatments didn&#x27;t work for me and it made an immediate difference. I don&#x27;t really get migraines anymore and I&#x27;m a much happier person in general whose started going to university and I&#x27;ve made some hilarious stoner friends as a result, so that&#x27;s funny too. What&#x27;s odd is my eyesight has improved to the point where I don&#x27;t need as strong as a glasses prescription. The glasses I got last December are now too strong for me so I am happy about that. I&#x27;m still not 100% yet, but\n even a year and a half in I&#x27;m still &quot;recovering&quot; from everyday migraines for over half a decade.<p>I&#x27;m blessed to live in Canada and not a place where medical cannabis is illegal. Even in legal US states (Washington, Colorado, et al) there is still the hypocrisy of the federal government\nacknowledging that cannabis has medical benefits, while still causing vexing legal problems for users.<p>Be well everyone.

They normally take one of three forms:<p>1) You are overreacting.  The EU isn&#x27;t going to come after some small fry operation, or some non-business entity.<p>This is an easy thing to say when you&#x27;re not personally exposed to the risk.  Would advocates of this position be willing to personally indemnify open source projects &#x2F; side projects against GDPR enforcement?  I suspect not, but perhaps there&#x27;s a business opportunity in giving them the opportunity to do so.  Sort of a GoFundMe for peer-to-peer insurance.<p>2) The GDPR is all about not being a jerk with your users&#x27; data.  As long as you don&#x27;t do that, and do relatively minor things X, Y and Z, you&#x27;re totally fine.<p>This flavor of argument might actually be true, but if I&#x27;m assuming the risk I&#x27;m probably going to want to hear it from someone with skin in the game, like a lawyer, who I can point to if it turns out to be false.  Even if I had the desire to read through the law (I don&#x27;t) and understand the specific implications for my project (I wouldn&#x27;t), the very act of doing this represents a cost that I could more simply avoid by excluding EU residents from my service.  I&#x27;d choose the latter path every time, and put &quot;support EU residents, check into the legal implications of GDPR&quot; on the roadmap, for &quot;someday&quot;.<p>3) You&#x27;re exposed to millions of risks anytime you do anything.  This is just one more and you&#x27;re making a big deal of it.<p>Often this accusation comes with a subtext that you&#x27;re trying to prove some political point, suggesting that you&#x27;re making a decision in bad faith to &quot;punish&quot; the EU.  Well, I personally think something like the GDPR is needed, and have no particular axe to grind, but I also have no idea if the legal exposure is serious, and no particular desire to put in the work to find out.<p>Yes, business, or really any activity, involves legal risk.  In this case though, the risk is pretty serious, first of all because the penalties (20M Euros max) are serious, and secondly because it will be very difficult to claim that you&#x27;ve never heard of the GDPR.  If Tonga creates some law impacting side hustles on the internet, at a minimum I can credibly claim to be unaware of that law.  The GDPR on the other hand has been all over the news for weeks.  I&#x27;ve clearly heard of it (especially now that I&#x27;ve commented on a discussion of it on HN).<p>My feeling is there&#x27;s a real risk that this law will lead to a general practice of non-EU individuals, and non-EU startups launching MVPs to at least temporarily block the EU to avoid unnecessary risk.  That&#x27;s not the intended purpose of the law, but laws have unintended consequences all the time. If the EU wants to avoid this unintended consequence they should provide a clear, objective, and cheap (in terms of both time and money), set of instructions that will allow projects like monal to continue operating there.  If such a set of instructions exists, I haven&#x27;t seen it.","commentId":"aae18e4a-8d46-4968-85e2-c820d8110c74","parentId":"35e54acb-58e4-4b3c-80b8-0567d381df9f"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"35e54acb-58e4-4b3c-80b8-0567d381df9f:undefined","_id":"YATCGiFonBer5iMA"}

To name two examples. The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen&#x27;s paper on entanglement “Can Quantum Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?” (Einstein et al. 1935) ignored as trash for decades. The Casimir effect was predicted from quantum theoretical calculations, but again, no-one did the experiment for decades because they felt it was a trash prediction that couldn&#x27;t be true &#x27;cause it ignored basic physical laws that everyone knew had always held and always would. Empty space just couldn&#x27;t do that. And on and on and on - I&#x27;ve just covered this century a tiny bit, not all the time since Newton. Dark energy anyone?<p>Knowledge of the mechanisms behind X doesn&#x27;t always precede discovery of X (why would anyone think it would always do so?) Lack of a known mechanism was why John Newlands version of the periodic table was greeted with contempt, and Mendeleev didn&#x27;t find it easy sledding at first, either. But the contempt was unjustified. Birds were able to fly before the airfoil was discovered or airflow understood. Electricity was a broad field of study (Maxwell&#x27;s equations, etc) long before the electron was discovered. The how usually trails the what in the history of science.<p>I won&#x27;t be shocked if the Emdrive is a wrong turn, but the idea we could <i>know</i> that in advance is sciencism - the satanic inversion of science - not empirical science.","commentId":"f2031695-839e-442e-8c96-314c6704cc02","parentId":"29eff9f4-8855-4932-821b-1f9549b340e4"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"1fff9a11-a439-4d2d-bdf2-8719987b8940:undefined","_id":"YAnxc8cNPxmdFVBI"}

Many people (even &quot;rational hacker-types&quot; ha-ha!) do not take the time to research, analyze or understand the regulations and laws that affect them.<p>2. Many people, even though they don&#x27;t understand said regulations, will have an extreme negative reaction to the new regulation especially when they see big scary numbers like numbers like &quot;$20M Euro&quot;. This is true even of regulations like the GDPR which most anybody should be able to read and understand in a couple of hours.<p>3. Many people don&#x27;t understand where regulations come from or how they work. They have no understanding of scope, process, judegement criteria or enforcement vectors. This leads to terrifying visions of &quot;EU cops&quot; waiting at airports to arrest people the moment they get off the plane.<p>Frankly, the whole situation speaks to the profound ignorance and fear that lies at the heart of the modern nation state. Citizens do not understand the government, they have no understanding of how or why it does what it does, all they really understand is that the government can and will completely ruin them should they violate one the tens of thousands of laws and rules and regulations and decrees that modern governments impose on their domains.<p>This ignorance has real consequences and costs. You can see this now particularly in Britain where many people are now learning how their country actually works <i>after</i> voting to tear down their current regulatory and economic framework. But you can also see it in all the fear and the moaning and the teeth gnashing every time some new regulation is proposed. (The funny thing here is that even the most hardcore libertarian economists are coming to understand that regulation does not impede economic growth [1]. Indeed there&#x27;s ample evidence that regulation, by imposing best practices on firms and increasing trust within the market, is a significant <i>driver</i> of economic growth.)<p>The reason I point this out on HN is because I think, at the end of the day, being an entrepreneur or an investor is all about learning how the world really works and then changing the world to work for you. And while most people can perhaps afford to plod along with all sorts of misguided notions about how the world works because their jobs do not require them to have any real understanding of the big picture, entrepeneurs and investors absolutely cannot. Buffet says it best: <i>&quot;Risk is not knowing what you&#x27;re doing.&quot;</i> The sites shutting down in the face of the GDPR out of fear and ignorance are making the most basic mistake, they literally do not know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marginalrevolution.com&#x2F;marginalrevolution&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;federal-regulation-not-cause-declining-dynamism.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marginalrevolution.com&#x2F;marginalrevolution&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;fe...</a>","commentId":"d8358b79-21f0-4487-97f2-c6077d24f7ab","parentId":"0666631e-2d24-478a-a90f-266984e59c7c"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"0666631e-2d24-478a-a90f-266984e59c7c:undefined","_id":"ZYwRkPOsUqpGq9ck"}

My main issue with the GDPR is that articles and supporters are constantly thinking in terms of &quot;business&quot; and not in terms of other services, and also not thinking in terms of long term impact.<p>For instance, I run a small community website (~30 people).  I receive no income, and I know everyone involved.  Everyone is in the United States.  Is it open to the world?  Yes, technically.  What happens when an EU resident signs up?  Well, I&#x27;ll continue to do exactly the way things are currently set up.<p>How does this situation play out long term?  First, I&#x27;ll tell whomever contacts me that I am in compliance with US law, and I&#x27;m a US citizen.  I do not have to follow their laws because it&#x27;s not within my jurisdiction.  Second, they will order me to block EU citizens from my site, which I will not do because it&#x27;s a mandate of work on me for no reason by a foreign country.<p>So what happens in this situation?  The only recourse for the EU is the internet version of &quot;sanctions&quot;, to block my website from the EU.<p>Now they&#x27;ve set a really interesting precedent.  How do they now enforce these blocks?  Technical issues aside, are they going to do a whitelist or a blacklist?  Regardless, they are setting up the equivalent of the Great Firewall for the purposes of maintaining the GDPR.<p>So why does this matter?  It&#x27;s only an isolated incident that will likely never occur, right?<p>Wrong.  One community website like mine with one EU citizen that decides to file a GDPR complaint means that somehow this situation occurs.  It can even be an intentional, &quot;sign up, file complaint&quot; immediately to trigger this legal situation.  Think there aren&#x27;t any foreign governments that wouldn&#x27;t flood a system like this to censor the EU citizens in various mild ways?  Think some random anarchist activist will not decide to monkey with the system by finding and reporting all the small violators?<p>The end product is a curation of the internet for EU citizens by EU government.  Hopefully your leaders are benevolent, and nothing crazy happens in the democratic process.  I remember being told during the Bush and Obama administrations that my views against government surveillance due to potential for abuse were unjustified because we could never have a horrible president and that our presidents will always be benevolent, so the policy would never change toward the worse.  How did that play out?  How do people think democracy functions, honestly?<p>Again, I really don&#x27;t care too much.  They can self censor if they want, but it really seems like GDPR is a win for Russian and Chinese meddling.","commentId":"58f9013b-9d68-4060-a928-5682f4c99fb2","parentId":"0666631e-2d24-478a-a90f-266984e59c7c"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"0666631e-2d24-478a-a90f-266984e59c7c:undefined","_id":"a22xcsVOE5FCKKwH"}

The other was to compose ringtones. Both popular things at the time. I was given access to an SMS gateway, a PDF of the Nokia message format and a deadline.<p>The exact UI was phone-dependent, but typically these updates would pop up a confirm box saying &quot;Accept new ringtone?&quot; or something similar. I was surprised to discover that this was triggered by sending an SMS, because there was usually no indication that a message had been received. If you were lucky you would be told where the file had come from, but often the phone just assumed it was an update from the network. On some phones there wasn&#x27;t even an alert, it would just obey, silently.<p>The message just had to start with &quot;&#x2F;&#x2F;SCKL&quot;, followed by a code, followed by some data. That&#x27;s it. On first reading I assumed the &quot;header&quot; part would require direct access to the SMS gateway, like the SMTP HELO or similar.<p>Nope. First thing I tried once I had some PoC data was to send a message from my phone directly to a colleague. It worked.<p>Over the course of that project I sent so many of those text messages I still can&#x27;t get the code &#x2F;&#x2F;SCKL1581 out of my head. JFTR, sending someone a really awful ringtone (a single diminished fifth or something) is way more annoying than sending them &quot;0&quot; as an operator logo, especially if their phone only has one ringtone.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.activexperts.com&#x2F;sms-component&#x2F;sms&#x2F;sckl&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.activexperts.com&#x2F;sms-component&#x2F;sms&#x2F;sckl&#x2F;</a>","commentId":"f9836fa6-c4fc-4665-9760-4093ca6e6295","parentId":"2d2b0cfa-1455-409b-84a0-aac999c343b9"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"2d2b0cfa-1455-409b-84a0-aac999c343b9:undefined","_id":"ak4fAREjNzc12CpS"}

It&#x27;s startling and highly unpleasant, but it&#x27;s not painful, for short bursts. I can&#x27;t speak for all systems, but for the ones I tested (albeit holding the collar in my hand, not on my neck), it was no worse than typical electric fencing, which is widely used.<p>2) These systems have the benefit of not affecting other animals, and dogs and other animals cannot get stuck in them. We had an electric fence around a duck nesting ground growing up, and I&#x27;ll never forget the morning we found a whimpering fox that had somehow gotten tangled in the wires. I guess it had jumped at the shock and pulled a wire off the fence? I don&#x27;t know. But it had the electrified wire wrapped around a back paw. At least it was a pulsing fence (rather than constant current); so the fox didn&#x27;t appear to have a bad burn, though I&#x27;m sure being stuck in it for hours was terrible (and truly painful).<p>2b) They also do not impede the traffic or cut off travel corridors of other wildlife, which can be a real problem in some areas.<p>3) Ordinary fences are (often) less effective. Given enough time and a large amount of fence that cannot be thoroughly checked &amp; repaired regularly, dogs will find a way to escape. They&#x27;ll dig under, they&#x27;ll jump over, they&#x27;ll climb, they&#x27;ll chew holes in, etc. We had a super smart lab who figured out how to climb a chain link fence. Depending on the risks of escape, this can be highly dangerous.<p>4) The risk of shock is typically very low. When these systems are installed, they are typically buried along natural boundaries, and when they aren&#x27;t, you put temporary flags in the ground to show the dog where the boundary is. So the dog very quickly learns the boundary, learns what the beep means, and rarely gets a shock after the first couple of days.<p>Overall, I don&#x27;t think these systems are signficantly less humane than other types of fencing – probably more humane if you&#x27;re comparing them to traditional electric fencing.<p>That said, these fences aren&#x27;t perfect either. I have another friend who installed one to keep his husky from leaving his ~3 acre yard, because the dog was breaking into a neighbor&#x27;s chicken coop. It worked for a while, but eventually that husky realized she could just get a running start, jump over the boundary, take the brief shock, and then be free. The drive to get those chickens was just too compelling. Of course, the drive to return home was not quite as strong. So she&#x27;d sit at the edge of boundary, whining to be let back into the yard.<p>A traditional fence might have been more effective in that case, though I think that husky would have found a way out. She was relentless and clever. They had to get rid of her eventually, when their neighbor threatened to put out bowls of antifreeze – now <i>that&#x27;s</i> disgusting! (To be fair, this was in rural Alabama ~15 years go, and that neighbor depended on the chickens&#x2F;eggs for food. Still disgusting, but the frustration is understandable if a dog is literally taking food out of your kid&#x27;s mouth.)","commentId":"cf780026-33c9-4a71-9523-50728c18db68","parentId":"bc780afc-f3a2-48cb-bfe5-3f6479a98718"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"61a48d36-b104-404e-af45-89384f8535de:undefined","_id":"bAePpVCed0YBPr0l"}

You need to identify what private information you collect.</i><p>Fair enough.<p><i>You need to decide what lawful basis you are using to collect that data. If you have no lawful basis, you have to stop collecting that data.</i><p>Right, but probably the most practically relevant basis for anything non-trivial will be legitimate interests, which of course involves balancing tests. Even today, just a week before this all comes into effect, there is little guidance about where regulators will find that balance.<p><i>If you are using consent lawful basis, you need to get consent in an opt-in manner. You need to record what statement you have shown to the user and any consent that you receive.</i><p>But this is retrospective and stronger than the previous requirement. Even if you have always been transparent about your intentions and acquired genuine opt-in from willing users, you are now likely to be on the wrong side of the GDPR if you can&#x27;t produce the exact wording that was on your web site or double opt-in email a decade ago. The most visible effect of the GDPR so far seems to be an endless stream of emails begging people to opt in to continue receiving things, even where people had almost certainly genuinely opted in already before.<p><i>For legitimate interest (which is essentially exactly the same as the laws that are currently on the books) you need to be able to exclude processing the data if someone objects.</i><p>Not quite. There also appear to be a balancing aspects here, though with some additional complications involving direct marketing, kids, and various other specific circumstances.<p>Take a common example of analytics for a web site. These may include personal data because of things like IP addresses or being tied to a specific account. Typically these have relatively low risk of harm for data subjects, but if for example a site deals with sensitive subject matter then that won&#x27;t necessarily be the case either.<p>A business might have a demonstrable interest in retaining that data for a considerable period in order to protect itself against fraud, violation of its terms, or other obviously serious risks. Maybe the regulators will consider that those interests outweigh the risk to an individual&#x27;s privacy if their IP address is retained for several years, at least in some cases. Maybe they will find differently if it&#x27;s the web site for a drug treatment clinic than if it&#x27;s an online gaming site.<p>Even if the subject matter isn&#x27;t sensitive, where does the line get drawn? A business that offers a lot of free material on its site to attract interest from visitors might itself have a legitimate interest in seeing who is visiting the site and tracking conversion flows that could involve several channels over a period of months. This is arguably less important than protecting against something like fraud, but nevertheless the whole model that provides the free material may only be viable if the conversions are good enough. But equally, maybe it&#x27;s not strictly necessary for the operation of the site and whatever services it offers for real money, so should the visitor&#x27;s interest in not having their IP address floating around in someone&#x27;s analytics database outweigh the site that is offering free content in exchange for little else in return?<p>That&#x27;s just one simple, everyday example of the ambiguity involved here, and as far as I&#x27;m aware the regulator in my country has yet to offer any guidance in this area. Would any of the GDPR&#x27;s defenders here like to give a black and white statement about this example and when the processing will or won&#x27;t be legal under the new regulations?<p><i>The other lawful bases are very unlikely to show up in most organisations.</i><p>I would think the basis that you have to comply with some other law is also likely to be quite common. It will immediately cover various personal data about identifying customers and recording their transactions for accounting purposes, for example. But again, since that will include the proof of location requirements for VAT purposes in some cases, how much evidence is a merchant required to keep to cover themselves on that front, and when does it cross into keeping too much under GDPR?<p><i>The other main problem is that if you want to use something other than contract basis, you need to build something that allows the user to exercise their rights.</i><p>And once again, those rights are significantly stronger under the GDPR, particularly around erasure or objecting to processing. Setting up new systems that comply may not be too difficult, but what about legacy systems that were not unreasonable at the time but don&#x27;t allow for isolated deletion of personal data? To my knowledge, there is still a lot of ambiguity around how far &quot;erasure&quot; actually goes, particularly regarding unstructured data such as emails or personal notes kept by staff while dealing with some issue, or potentially long-lived data in archives that are available but no longer in routine use. And then you get all the data that is built incrementally, from source control systems to blockchain, where by construction it may be difficult or impossible to selectively erase partial data in the middle.<p><i>Not to put too fine a point on that, personally I highly approve of this. I really could care less if somebody&#x27;s business model is destroyed because it is now too expensive to collect information that you don&#x27;t need to do the job.</i><p>But what if an online service&#x27;s business model relies on processing profile data for purposes such as targeting ads to be viable, and regulators decide that a subject&#x27;s right to object to that processing outweighs its necessity to the financial model?<p>It&#x27;s easy to say a lot of people might not like being tracked, but on the other hand, if services like Google and Facebook all disappeared in the EU as a result of the GDPR, I&#x27;m not sure how popular it would be. There are two legitimate sides to this debate, and neither extreme is obviously correct.","commentId":"36eac5ab-10d1-4e94-9ada-bd9cd640d9d3","parentId":"a1571f1d-32d9-4472-9a44-70e2f925a1d9"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"35e54acb-58e4-4b3c-80b8-0567d381df9f:undefined","_id":"bJS7qeO1sIgYL04I"}

Although DPOs are allowed to have other functions, they can only be entrusted with other\ntasks and duties provided that these do not give rise to conflicts of interests. This entails in particular\nthat the DPO cannot hold a position within the organisation that leads him or her to determine the\npurposes and the means of the processing of personal data. Due to the specific organisational structure\nin each organisation, this has to be considered case by case.<p>&gt; As a rule of thumb, conflicting positions within the organisation may include senior management\npositions (such as chief executive, chief operating, chief financial, chief medical officer, head of\nmarketing department, head of Human Resources or head of IT departments) but also other roles lower\ndown in the organisational structure if such positions or roles lead to the determination of purposes\nand means of processing. In addition, a conflict of interests may also arise for example if an external\nDPO is asked to represent the controller or processor before the Courts in cases involving data\nprotection issues.<p>In summary, if you have power to decide how or for what purposes the processing of the data is to be carried out you&#x27;re probably not allowed to serve as DPO. Of course in the end it&#x27;s the company&#x27;s decision who to give that role to, but not following the guidelines increases the chance of non-compliance.<p>1: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;article29&#x2F;item-detail.cfm?item_id=612048\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;article29&#x2F;item-detail.cfm?item_...</a>","commentId":"bc171b97-8773-4807-b376-2b015e8e8d8b","parentId":"6243c841-5d37-45a2-9f6b-fe83740b4cf1"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"35e54acb-58e4-4b3c-80b8-0567d381df9f:undefined","_id":"bPKILuByXOcvxspb"}

If a class happens to match a real-world thing, well that&#x27;s just a coincidence.  A programmer&#x27;s job is to get the computer to do what you want, not somehow model the world.<p>At the same time, the right abstraction can make all the difference.  While tactically, my process is very similar to the author&#x27;s, what turns workmanlike code into true craft is finding the right concept that dramatically reduces cognitive burden on the programmer.","commentId":"fcdc65cc-f592-47c2-b4f8-8a421bcd010e","parentId":"5a05d982-2411-46b8-adb8-91f8c7ee1ca8"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"5a05d982-2411-46b8-adb8-91f8c7ee1ca8:undefined","_id":"d9xHfKKEOjm857Zi"}

How is a random guy releasing free (or cheap) services on the internet supposed to deal with a situation like that?  The arbitrary nature of the enforcement is exactly what makes this a problem.

And if I can solve the problem once and for all by taking the unfortunate step of simply cutting EU residents off of the service, then I&#x27;m going to at least consider that option, and probably take it in the short term.<p>If the EU wants to reassure people that &quot;The regulators send a letter asking you to come back into compliance unless you&#x27;ve been really bad.

Say the car in front of the Volvo changes lanes or turns off the road, leaving nothing between the Volvo and a stopped car. &quot;Pilot Assist will ignore the stationary vehicle and instead accelerate to the stored speed,&quot; Volvo&#x27;s manual reads, meaning the cruise speed the driver punched in. &quot;The driver must then intervene and apply the brakes.” In other words, your Volvo won&#x27;t brake to avoid hitting a stopped car that suddenly appears up ahead. It might even accelerate towards it.<p>&gt; <i>The same is true for any car currently equipped with adaptive cruise control, or automated emergency braking</i>. It sounds like a glaring flaw, the kind of horrible mistake engineers race to eliminate. Nope. These systems are designed to ignore static obstacles because otherwise, they couldn&#x27;t work at all.<p>&gt; “You always have to make a balance between braking when it’s not really needed, and not braking when it is needed,” says Erik Coelingh, head of new technologies at Zenuity, a partnership between Volvo and Autoliv formed to develop driver assistance technologies and self-driving cars. He&#x27;s talking about false positives. On the highway, slamming the brakes for no reason can be as dangerous as not stopping when you need to.","commentId":"a0176f02-0ddf-47c0-b1f4-76639d494fe8","parentId":"7b494130-ccb2-46ea-92c1-9c09c16d00ba"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"d5c0d093-c926-488a-81df-8ffaa4ab64df:undefined","_id":"ekedCgMrTi3orWmb"}

I have hundreds of friends and tens of pages on FB, which I&#x27;ll admit by FB&#x27;s standards isn&#x27;t all that much, yet I still find it much harder to browse than other sites with many times the content. Most people simply don&#x27;t post that often or not at all, and the pages I joined don&#x27;t post often either.<p>Despite how little content there is I find the issue of managing it all completely intractable. When I&#x27;m on Feedly I go through hundreds of posts worth of content in a few minutes by mashing the j key until I find content I want to read later, save it and then spend maybe 2 hours a week going through content I care about. When I&#x27;m on Twitter I skim until I see familiar content and pick out the stuff I care about. When I&#x27;m on reddit, I know it takes about 48 hours for my feed to &quot;refresh&quot; so I&#x27;ll spend some time every other day skimming from top to bottom.<p>I can&#x27;t even begin to figure out a workflow for finding content on Facebook. The whole thing is laid out so quickly finding the things I care about is impossible. I can scroll past ten posts I&#x27;ve seen before something new pops up so I have no idea when to stop scrolling. There&#x27;s no concept of a &quot;read&quot; post and unlike reddit the &quot;hide&quot; button, hidden behind a menu, acts like a downvote. I have no way of creating a single stream of just the things I care about, and if I did there&#x27;s no way to update myself when things change. Unlike youtube, there&#x27;s no RSS feeds so I can&#x27;t just do my browsing from Feedly. Even just getting a feed of my events is impossible since FB has the audacity to suggest events from pages I&#x27;ve never interacted with, have no friends going and thinks those are more important to me than the events created by pages I actually follow. Push notifications are insanely coursely-grained (or at least they do a good job hiding the interface). Cambridge Analytica be damned, the reason I don&#x27;t use FB is because I can&#x27;t figure out how. My age, income level and computer-addicted brain should make me prime meat for advertisers, yet I change the oil more often than login to FB simply because the algorithms that generate my feeds are just that bad.","commentId":"9f462e5b-7540-4e10-9cd9-ca28737d105f","parentId":"a46b4956-015d-4acd-a054-90c11877e142"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"8f140ef1-9004-4324-adb5-352c3939568f:undefined","_id":"f4xYE4gHcetBtOmI"}

If that function stops getting used, you can throw it away.<p>Doing that well ahead of time requires an extremely good idea of how the program will behave at run time, and even with good information, is still very likely to bloat up your binary hugely.

The fact that research is carried out via centralized journals is a relic of a practice that is over 300 years old, when printed paper was the only feasible medium to distribute such research.<p>If scientific research had started in this century, I am pretty sure no researcher would have ever thought of publishing research papers in a centralized journal where the journal gets to make so much money for a contribution that is not commensurate. Instead, they would have chosen an online platform that is funded and managed by the universities and research centers participating in this platform.<p>What you are saying is equivalent to stating a tautology: Elsevier is still important for researchers&#x27; careers because Elsevier is still important for researchers&#x27; careers.<p>The deeper question I ask is: Why is Elsevier or such centralized journals still important for researchers&#x27; careers?<p>Why can&#x27;t the academia move to a model where only the impact of the paper matter where the impact is measured by some open source metrics like citations, number of stars, etc. I am not suggesting these exact same metrics. These are only examples. But it should be possible. For example, in the software world, GNU, Linux, Node.js, Git, etc. did not become important by publishing in a centralized journal but by publishing on open repositories, some amount of marketing, and by the virtue of being very useful. What prevents existing researchers from moving to such a model? If enough influential people move to this model, Elsevier and others automatically become unimportant.","commentId":"2713893c-b4f9-45a0-9160-4e33f1363926","parentId":"bd240217-2345-4720-8edc-1b994082f6fc"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"3ab3a03d-a63a-45a2-b863-5162e931da91:undefined","_id":"fWmr8AglDHzirr6v"}

That is unacceptable.<p>US cell phone carriers including AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon share personal information, including phone numbers and real-time location of cell phones, with companies such as LocationSmart, who then resells the information to other companies for marketing and other purposes. Carriers to not provide a way for users to opt-out of such sharing. This is completely legal under the current Electronic Communications Privacy Act. LocationSmart claims that they will not share the gathered information without user consent, but the definition of consent is vague, and that doesn&#x27;t protect the public from security breaches. I understand that carriers need to have location data to comply with emergency 911 regulations, but it is unacceptable that they are able to share it with 3rd parties who may use it for dubious purposes, and may have lax security standards.<p>We need to have laws that protect the privacy of cell phone users, and do not allow carriers to sell personal information to 3rd parties. Or, and the very least, customers should be able to opt-out of such sharing from their carriers.<p>For more information on the vulnerability found yesterday, please see: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krebsonsecurity.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;tracking-firm-locationsmart-leaked-location-data-for-customers-of-all-major-u-s-mobile-carriers-in-real-time-via-its-web-site&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krebsonsecurity.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;tracking-firm-locationsm...</a><p>Please contact me if you have any questions.<p>Thank you,\nXX","commentId":"0f5650e2-3a22-4fe4-9bc9-734299bf7e05","parentId":"2af569af-d0fd-46a4-8650-6a96066db10d"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"fe4ea01a-e961-470c-9fe3-78bf99b64e18:undefined","_id":"fqGzXqiyBs69s6OG"}

In front of this origin they had a server that did auth and auth only. If your auth worked at the edge, the request was sent to origin. The problem is I found a specific input that caused an error dumping a stack trace that contained the origin hostname. I took the original request and replayed it directly at the origin. To my surprise the response was the same as going through the auth server. Then I changed the user id some integer that wasn&#x27;t mine and got information back. Then I quit playing with it and sent an email.<p>This leaves me in a weird spot because I was fuzzing them looking for details when I was fully aware they did not have a bug bounty program. Why did I do this? Because I was using the app myself, I&#x27;m a security guy, and had read about a cool exploit with the uber app. It only took about 5 minutes of setting up burp proxy for my phone with ssl and 5 more minutes of auditing to find an input that dumped the stack trace.","commentId":"ec54a448-c18c-4634-840e-c71564e86dc5","parentId":"3cae4aa9-6c7f-49ec-a19f-c74afe1f2e2a"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"fe4ea01a-e961-470c-9fe3-78bf99b64e18:undefined","_id":"gALp1lQkxyfipjZY"}

Shock collars can be used for abuse.

But damn do they work. After a day or two the &#x27;beep&#x27; of the shock collar is enough negative reinforcement to stop the dog(s) from retrying the ol&#x27; 10 foot pole vault.<p>And before I let my dog(s) use it I tried it on myself.<p>The shock it&#x27;s self was pretty harmless, certainly not comfortable, but the longer I stayed near the perimeter the more often the shocks were deployed. I learnt my lesson quick enough.<p>Except for one of my foster dogs anyway, he was a 60kg athletic failed pig hunting hybrid mongrol named Loki, looked like a Bull Arab crossed with a Great Dane. I named him Loki because of his tenacity and ingenuity for getting in trouble.<p>He learnt if he ran up the adjacent wall (attached to the house, that didn&#x27;t have an invisible fence line) quick enough, he could be mid-flight before the shocks were administered and when momentum is carrying you through the air at 12 feet, over the shock line, the shocks don&#x27;t do shit. You&#x27;re already flying. And the shocks stop well before you hit the ground on the other side so you can gracefully land and wonder a few streets to go meet Nani at the local Cafe for free biscuits and pats for an hour. While I rode my bicycle home to &#x27;rescue&#x27; him from getting fat.<p>Alas. Similar to the Cayote. His abuse from prior owners saw him lose the meta-game in the long run. The abuse saw massive changes in behavior between loveable giant to dangerous beast from the smallest changes in environment. Even after 12 months of behavioural monitoring and professional dog therapy from I and his rescue organisation, he was not for long for this world. The level of risk from his occasional aggressive outbursts at times were just too high.<p>Still one of my favourite dogs. Miss the guy every day.<p>Anyway. Thanks for reading. And PS, as a last option. Shock collars are great.

You need to identify what private information you collect.  You need to decide what lawful basis you are using to collect that data.  If you have no lawful basis, you have to stop collecting that data.  When you collect the data you need to notify the user under what lawful bases you are collecting the data.  If you are using consent lawful basis, you need to get consent in an opt-in manner.  You need to record what statement you have shown to the user and any consent that you receive.<p>If you are using only contract basis for the data it&#x27;s <i>really</i> easy.  You tell them that you are using their data for purposes of fulfilling the contract.  The great thing about contract basis is they can&#x27;t object.  The only thing you need to do is to inform the customer of any 3rd parties you send their information to in order to fulfil the contract.<p>It only gets complicated if you want to use the data for other things.  For legitimate interest (which is essentially <i>exactly the same as the laws that are currently on the books</i>) you need to be able to exclude processing the data if someone objects.  You also need to make sure that you don&#x27;t delete their data if they exercise their right of removal (which is completely bass-ackwards, but whatever).  Consent is similar actually, but you have to get the consent up front.  The other lawful bases are very unlikely to show up in most organisations.<p>I think the main problem with most organisations (and it&#x27;s the case with the company I work for at the moment) is that control of private information is very loose.  For example, we use several SaaS systems for our marketing.  Some of them are clearly unnecessary and so we either have to remove that functionality or get consent.  So there&#x27;s lots of discussions about whether it is worth a huge wad of text thrown at the user in order to have cat emoji&#x27;s or some stupid thing like that.<p>The other main problem is that if you want to use something other than contract basis, you need to build something that allows the user to exercise their rights.  It can be a manual process, but if you have a lot of users it might threaten the margin.<p>Anyway, long story short: If you are only gathering the information that you need to do the work you are doing, there is likely very little (or in a lot of cases I bet nothing) to do.  If you are gathering the information to use for your own purposes, then there may be a lot that you need to do.<p>Not to put too fine a point on that, personally I highly approve of this.  I really could care less if somebody&#x27;s business model is destroyed because it is now too expensive to collect information that you don&#x27;t need to do the job.  Even in the company I work for, where we don&#x27;t actually use the data for nefarious purposes (AFAICT ;-) ), we&#x27;re <i>finally</i> having some long overdue conversations about what stupid SaaS crap we&#x27;re using under the hood.  Not to be unkind, but I utterly fail to understand how marketing people fall for the same lies that they spew out themselves... &quot;If only we send our customer&#x27;s data to this service, they will find a way to drive more business our way!  And we don&#x27;t even have to pay them!&quot;  Yeah... right...","commentId":"a1571f1d-32d9-4472-9a44-70e2f925a1d9","parentId":"ec5cce6f-2cdd-4c87-80af-e925ddca428f"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"35e54acb-58e4-4b3c-80b8-0567d381df9f:undefined","_id":"iGlLEYJQj8LVOiQP"}

The point about abstraction and choosing the right abstraction for the problem at hand requires each of us to be able to communicate clearly with the problem domain subject matter experts and understand what they need from us.<p>Understanding what kinds of abstractions are available to us and how to apply is important. There is a proviso however, and this is where even though two problems may seem to be similar and could be usefully use the same abstraction, one must understand the problem space ramifications of those abstractions as the divergences can often come back and bite you.<p>Over the decades, many tools have been developed and each of them has some use in our toolbox, whether it be top-down design, bottom-up design, refactoring, objects, values, functional programming, assembly programming, static typing,  dynamic typing, etc., etc., etc.<p>They do not have universal application, unless of course, your favourite is a hammer and everything is a nail. These tools allow us to solve different kinds of problems in a less laborious way.<p>If anything, the last forty years has shown me that, as a whole, each generation of programmers is unable to learn from the previous generations.

It&#x27;s also true that there are many international turkers for whom $8&#x2F;hour or less is still solid pay. Then there are also many third-party tools that allow turkers to see which HIT (task) requesters have good track records (low rejection ratio, good pay, etc.), and the site&#x27;s own tools allow requesters to avoid turkers with bad track records. In my experience just browsing through tasks, heavily underpaid tasks don&#x27;t tend to get done (for example, writing a 100-word summary for $0.50).","commentId":"ffe68c21-3ded-4810-821f-f64718d058aa","parentId":"7c375499-9cc9-4ef2-abc6-36040428ae9f"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"7c375499-9cc9-4ef2-abc6-36040428ae9f:undefined","_id":"jCwYfEqiodAy0xSl"}

The candidate gets back a formatted dump by email of all sorts of recruitment data, including interview notes, etc. There are obvious ways to monetise a service like this, hence incentive for someone to do it. Recruitment at a large company means engaging with thousands of people and then rejecting them. It is natural for people to have bruised feelings, and also to be curious about why they were not hired. A GDPR button lets them indulge their curiousity and start digging in to interview notes etc.<p>Naturally GDPR requests like this won&#x27;t flood a company on the first day of GDPR.

They can exude a sort of confidence, especially psychopaths because of the lack of a strong emotional tether. At the core is an insecurity about how smart they know they are, a compulsive desire to maintain dominance of attention, and a sort of boredom about how dumb everyone is. The boredom about how dumb people are also isn&#x27;t in the least true, but it&#x27;s a feeling with built in confirmation bias. Smart people move away from them quickly and they don&#x27;t see the emotional heisman move people do to avoid them. They don&#x27;t realize that a lot of people that stick with them know who they are and what they are doing, but love them anyways too.<p>Personality disorders are complicated as hell.

I suffered from migraines for about 17 years and due to sensitivities, I couldn&#x27;t take most of the usual remedies (triptans).  Migraine is one of those things that is frustratingly misunderstood -- they&#x27;re not just &quot;bad headaches&quot;[0], they come with all kinds of other, fun, symptoms and at least in my case, lasted between one and three days with light and sound sensitivity[1] and nausea to boot.  I could expect to get them in the fall and spring about once a week.  I, literally, wrote a Visual Studio extension to enhance text on my screen when viewed at the lowest contrast&#x2F;brightness setting and purchased a laptop after carefully reviewing the quality of the display and any hints I could find about how dark the screen could be made to go (Asus ended up being excellent at the time).<p>That said, I haven&#x27;t had been hit with migraine symptoms for two years.  If you&#x27;re living with this condition and treatment for it has failed, I <i>strongly</i> recommend changing doctors, and if you haven&#x27;t gone beyond your GP, do yourself a favor and go to a practice that specializes in headaches.  There are more than a few older, lesser-known medicines that successfully treat migraine off-label.  In my case, it&#x27;s a low dose of Depakote[2] -- which is available in generic form.  Outside of my deductible, it&#x27;s under a buck a month, inside it, it&#x27;s under $10.  When it was prescribed to me, there were no references on any of the typical places (WebMD, drugs, et. al) about it being used to treat Migraine.  But when I searched on the medication, there were plenty of anecdotal reports from patients stating that the medication -- which was prescribed for bipolar, usually (another off-label use, it&#x27;s an old medication that was originally prescribed for seizures) -- had resulted in elimination of migraine or a dramatic reduction in the pain[3].  When I last looked, the major sites had it listed as an off-label use.  The best part about the medication (well, other than it working) for me is that my body responds very well to it -- I&#x27;ve had <i>nothing</i> in the way of negative side-effects, though there were a few, surprising, positive ones.<p>Anything dealing with the brain is tricky -- the medications, including the one I&#x27;m taking, have odd and downright scary side-effects.  And there&#x27;s usually a page full of them.  The cause of migraine isn&#x27;t particularly understood, either.  Considering how different symptoms are for this affliction among those who have it, it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if it&#x27;s found out to be a large collection of different maladies one day.<p>[0] Well, for me, they certainly <i>were</i> bad headaches, too.<p>[1] Sensitivity is the best word - with light, it was anything bright and cold, but with sound it didn&#x27;t have to be loud.  The worst pain would come from nearly any noise emanating from a mobile phone or tablet speaker at any volume level.  It would electrify the pain in my head.<p>[2] Which, it turns out, might have additional benefits: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;return-to-the-teenage-brain.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;return-to-the-tee...</a><p>[3] I&#x27;d consider it &quot;eliminated&quot; in me.  I get them <i>extremely</i> rarely, and when I do, I can&#x27;t entirely be sure it&#x27;s even migraine based on the symptoms ... I still have sensitivities to light&#x2F;sound but instead of it feeling like the pain was turned up well past 11, I just feel a sort of pressure&#x2F;head-annoyance that&#x27;s difficult to describe.  Honestly, I&#x27;d rather deal with that <i>every</i> day than get a migraine headache even once in a year and I joke (without laughing) that I haven&#x27;t had one in so long that if I got one, I&#x27;d probably have to lay in bed for 3 days.  It&#x27;s been a few years now, though, so my concern about that happening is diminished quite a bit.","commentId":"fc1423a9-b173-4605-a5f5-5b6319f1ce4b","parentId":"8607a42b-c0a4-452a-866b-d5b3068f3ce6"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"8607a42b-c0a4-452a-866b-d5b3068f3ce6:undefined","_id":"l2rH3WFNZE1IBVdH"}

I was lucky it only lasted for three days (I was instructed to immediately discontinue use of the drug, preventing any long term damage). The trial was called off shortly after - if memory serves, out of ~100+ participants in my age group, about five had the same symptoms.<p>As the article mentions, there’s a risk around toxicity. The approved distribution, dosage, and delivery seems to be an entirely different process from 15+ years ago, so here’s to the best. But, there’s really not a single measurement of residual peptide buildup throughout the entire study.<p>I worry about long term buildup of proinflammatory mediators that could eventually strike back fast and hard with long term ocular nerve damage; a similar effect as the earlier drug iterations of a higher toxicity.","commentId":"348828b2-3f9a-4220-9871-8287dea07229","parentId":"8607a42b-c0a4-452a-866b-d5b3068f3ce6"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"8607a42b-c0a4-452a-866b-d5b3068f3ce6:undefined","_id":"lfZQsA27uh0sRadY"}

Most claims here seem to relate to a ruling, where the IP address was deemed personal data in the hands of an ISP, who would be able to resolve it to a real person [1]. If you hold an IP address, but can&#x27;t connect it to a real person (e.g. by having legal means to convince the ISP to give you that name based on the address), then it seems the IP address would not even be personal data in the first place. In the particularly ruling, the operator of the webserver was the German government, which presumably has more legal power to make an ISP turn over identifying data on a customer than a random website would have.<p>In any case, I hope some more clarity about this will emerge soon. But what you are talking about here would at best be a borderline infraction (and probably just be covered under legitimate interest). OTOH, what the person starting this thread had in mind seems to be that all the data he might collect on his users is fair game to do with as he pleases.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitecase.com&#x2F;publications&#x2F;alert&#x2F;court-confirms-ip-addresses-are-personal-data-some-cases\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitecase.com&#x2F;publications&#x2F;alert&#x2F;court-confirms-...</a>","commentId":"52df944d-7373-4883-b20b-782a2144a4b7","parentId":"9a8212de-5390-4693-8de6-a34b9cd6b73c"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"35e54acb-58e4-4b3c-80b8-0567d381df9f:undefined","_id":"mATreLPLsgy28vdd"}

I can just chill and focus on what’s in front of me. It’s also great for relieving some chronic pain I have when ibuprofen doesn’t cut it; it’s maybe a step above naproxen, and I think the pain relief is part of the general stress reduction that I perceive as anxiety relief.<p>If I’m making capsules, it tends to last longer (4–5 hours, peak around 3 hours), so I may only take it once or twice a day as a general relief thing; if I mix it with a beverage (fruit smoothies in my case) and drink it, it comes on stronger but doesn’t last as long (3–4 hours, peak around 1–2 hours), which is better for PRN relief, but if I do that then I might end up taking it thrice or, uh, fource a day, which feels like too much, so I try to avoid that. It’s also good to take periodic breaks to avoid building tolerance.<p>Typically I take larger doses (6–10g) of “down” red varieties (Maeng Da, Thai, Borneo, Bali) for anxiety, pain, and sleep; smaller doses (3–5g) of “up” green&#x2F;white varieties (Jong Kong, Thai) for stimulation, as a less anxiety-inducing alternative to caffeine. The difference between “strains” is noticeable but usually not that significant in my experience; dosage is typically more important. I recommend avoiding extracts—they can be more addictive as they can be 10–50× more potent than regular leaf powder (1–2% mitragynine&#x2F;7-OH-mitragynine), and I find them less pleasant anyway.<p>It doesn’t cause any cognitive impairment that I’ve observed. For some reason it especially makes me want to write, which is great for documenting my code and figuring out a problem, but it doesn’t provide any real cognitive boost either. Taking a low dose before class might make you more energetic and social, but overall I don’t think it’d help or harm your focus much. Personally, when taking an “up” dose, I’d rather clean or go for a walk than go to class&#x2F;work. Different people react differently, of course.<p>If you take <i>too</i> much, it’ll make you woozy, sleepy, and nauseated, which as you can imagine isn’t great for getting things done. If that happens, you pretty much need to drink water, eat food, lie down, close your eyes, wait for it to pass—or barf if you need to. Most people only take too much kratom <i>once</i>, hah—it’s highly unpleasant.<p>Kratom is <i>not</i> a wonder-drug—all it really does in my experience is take you from “not fine” to just “fine”. If you’re just looking to get “high”, kratom is not for you. It is habit-forming and can be addictive with frequent high doses or especially when taking extracts. Side effects may include constipation, more frequent urination, irritability, and (rarely) reduced testosterone in males. Withdrawal symptoms may include sweating, runny nose, diarrhea, dilated pupils, and elevated testosterone. Most people don’t experience most of these side effects or withdrawal symptoms, though.<p>Finally, and most importantly, kratom is under-researched and <i>caveat emptor</i>. There have been no confirmed cases of kratom alone causing death, but as a precaution it should not be taken in conjunction with other drugs or medications, and should only be purchased from reputable sellers; if you’re buying it in a smoke shop, make sure it’s a known, reputable brand in properly sealed packaging. My hope is that it will remain legal and be regulated for quality and purity in the future.","commentId":"b2959e07-7af9-437e-9731-5d6045c38453","parentId":"00447554-046b-4743-b91e-71ef4b5dd652"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"1c9c85b9-df6f-4f14-a844-4f50ca58e88d:undefined","_id":"mQUOfcgARpQWSagY"}

GDPR is just a proxy fight between the left and the right and is showing all the same characteristics.<p>Consider adventured&#x27;s sibling post - it quite astutely points out that GDPR discussions are much more vitriolic than you&#x27;d expect for discussions of the minutiae of data handling. People who say that GDPR compliance is hard are being attacked on a personal level. He explains it as &#x27;emotional investment&#x27; in GDPR but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good explanation; the people arguing most strongly for it are also those saying it&#x27;s not much work, so that seems backwards. You&#x27;d expect people who put in the most effort to be most emotionally invested in it.<p>There&#x27;s a much better explanation available: your view on GDPR is a direct consequence of your assumptions about human nature. If you believe in the existence of benign and enlightened technocrats then GDPR seems like excellent progress towards building a better world - it&#x27;s extreme vagueness and severe penalties are exactly what&#x27;s needed to foster obedience to technocratic elites. People who complain about this are just being unnecessarily awkward ... <i>just be reasonable</i> after all, and you&#x27;ll be fine! The EU are reasonable so if you&#x27;re reasonable too, you have nothing to fear! From this perspective, anyone who objects to GDPR or actually decides compliance is impossible must - almost by definition - be being unreasonable. What are they hiding? Why can&#x27;t they just get on board; the only answer available is that they have flawed characters and any points they make about gray-area debatable things like cost:benefit ratios must be some sort of obfuscation.<p>If on the other hand you believe the whole idea of wise and beneficent bureaucrats is naive, then GDPR looks like a hell of a lot like a power grab by the very sort of people who shouldn&#x27;t be able to grab power. Vagueness is of deep concern because it&#x27;s in the shadows of vagueness that abuse can be found, and when a law is <i>nothing but</i> vagueness, it even makes sense to question to motives of those who created it - that&#x27;s a problem because lots of self-styled Europeans have bought into the EU&#x27;s utopian rhetoric and can&#x27;t separate criticism of the EU from criticism of themselves and their desired future.<p>There&#x27;s no real scientific way to prove whose assumptions about human nature are right. The USSR was a rare example of a real-life experiment in who was right and for a long time it proved the American style, conservative, small weak government is better mentality to have superior results. But that was decades ago and many have forgotten or weren&#x27;t alive back then, so now rule by technocratic dictatorship seems  attractive again.<p>As a consequence GDPR discussions will always have the same flavour as Clinton v Trump debates, or Brexit debates, or whether to restrict spending on political campaigning. They are ultimately about the same issues.","commentId":"f9063134-9db9-49f3-b83f-289a3b9cc8e8","parentId":"0a396465-333f-45db-9ebf-d864d2f03afe"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"35e54acb-58e4-4b3c-80b8-0567d381df9f:undefined","_id":"mRyGckgaDl5cm7QK"}

For EMDrive to be real, virtually everything we know to be true about physics would have to be false: if you&#x27;re saying conservation of momentum can be violated, or conservation of energy can be violated, then basically all of modern physics would have to be wrong.<p>When science, and especially physics, advances, it is very rarely, if ever since Newton&#x27;s time, that the settled physics is 100% wrong. Instead, the &quot;old&quot; physics tends to be an approximation under most conditions, or there is a new phenomenon that can be explained without really violating the old rules. For example, conservation of momentum still holds under special relativity, it&#x27;s just that we discovered things without mass can have momentum.<p>Thus, the only explanation that would really be plausible is if there is &quot;something else&quot; going on with the EMDrive where momentum and energy are still conserved, just that there is something happening beyond our current understanding of &quot;energy&quot; or &quot;momentum&quot;.

(You couldn&#x27;t use RDS though, at least not today.) Putting your db on something also called &quot;ephemeral storage&quot; seems risky, but maybe not much riskier than putting it on plain HDDs. The big issue to me is that most instances don&#x27;t come with much space. If you need more you have to scale up the whole instance (not a separate dimension like with EBS), and if you&#x27;re already on the biggest instance type you&#x27;re just out of luck. I guess it could be worthwhile to use separate tablespaces so you could have some data on instance storage and some on EBS.

Raccoons are takers, not schemers.<p>From Wikipedia<p>&gt;&gt; Zoologist Clinton Hart Merriam described raccoons as &quot;clever beasts&quot;, and that &quot;in certain directions their cunning surpasses that of the fox.&quot; The animal&#x27;s intelligence gave rise to the epithet &quot;sly coon&quot;.[120] Only a few studies have been undertaken to determine the mental abilities of raccoons, most of them based on the animal&#x27;s sense of touch. In a study by the ethologist H. B. Davis in 1908, raccoons were able to open 11 of 13 complex locks in fewer than 10 tries and had no problems repeating the action when the locks were rearranged or turned upside down. Davis concluded they understood the abstract principles of the locking mechanisms and their learning speed was equivalent to that of rhesus macaques.<p>Learning speed equivalent to the macaques?

They are after companies tracking you across real estate and selling relevant data from their vast silos to companies that can market stuff to you. They tried many ways already to prevent this kind of practice in some countries but loopholes were found so this is the hammer. As a small company, if you answer and act on actual user complaints, you have no worries no matter what the language. It is not in their interest to go for small offences. And if your story is reasonable, like OP, they will just let it go.<p>What this gives the EU is the hammer to hit persistent abusers of user data. They want you to be careful with user data and not treat it like you own it; you do not. It is not yours to sell or share or publicize.<p>Edit; note as well that every country has a compliance office; if they know you are in complaince as in you are ‘good people’ (best effort, no giant holes etc; just best practice in our field which you should do anyway) they will not bother you with every (or any) user complaint after that. I have good experiences with this with far grave (and potentially criminally punishable) matters in a few EU countries.","commentId":"8db3f479-ffde-4ec3-a36b-da4065d814b0","parentId":"7aff4c10-cd4c-4f60-985b-fb13f68acf77"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"35e54acb-58e4-4b3c-80b8-0567d381df9f:undefined","_id":"sGjfYMn7j2U0lr1S"}

This allows type annotations in the function signature. Cannoli leverages both type annotations in function signatures and assignments to output optimized code. Other projects like Pythran also use type annotations.<p>PEP 3107 does say:<p>&gt; By itself, Python does not attach any particular meaning or significance to annotations.<p>However, I think this will change especially as more projects begin to outperform CPython. In the &quot;Results &gt; Object Optimization&quot; section of the thesis paper, I cover using these very type annotations to optimize the code.<p>The biggest problem with Python annotations right now is that they don&#x27;t really mean anything. Nothing is really enforced so it is totally valid to have &#x27;x : int = &quot;string&quot;&#x27;. The compiler would have to just ignore this annotation since it was provided the wrong data. This could also be difficult to identify if a variable was being used and its type mislabeled.

I never got in particularly much trouble, but many of my friends were screwed by minor miscommunication which incompetent adults escalated beyond any reason.<p>And yes, under the circumstances (assuming the goal is to avoid problems, instead of to aggravate the staff, perform ad-hoc psychology experiments, or the like), any high school student should avoid contradicting the staff in public, start by acquiescing to any request that doesn’t pose an immediate injury risk, disengage quickly and completely and then marshal their parents’ help if there has been any kind of mistake that will affect them academically.<p>Few teenagers have figured this out though.

The Right to be forgotten is the easy part. Having to document everything you do and introduce data-dumping mechanisms that are both anonymous and secure is administrative burden. Having to do that for every little project that you release, even if it has 10 users, is a bit too much. Many developers cast a wide net, releasing products often, and this is practically unnecessary work unless you have a significant amount of users.<p>Introducing opt-in forms everywhere is also not great. It didn&#x27;t work for Windows Vista so why do we expect this to work on the web? Opt-ins for things like cookies should be implemented on the browser. What&#x27;s the point of warning a person before sharing their email? What&#x27;s the point of warning them even you &#x27;ll install a cookie? IP addresses and cookies etc are integral parts of the HTTP protocol and the browser so why not introduce anti-tracking regulation that targets browser vendors and telcos instead of introducing regulation that targets every developer on the planet? It  doesn&#x27;t seem like an optimal plan imho. The example of the cookie law (for which it&#x27;s hard to argue that it has not utterly failed) should act as a bad precedent, not a good one.<p>It&#x27;s easy for US developers to be positive of GDPR because they can avoid the overreaching parts, but for us in the EU its something we have to abide by 100% of the time. I &#x27;d like to hear what other people think about those, because otherwise i hear a lot of emotional praise for GDPR which is blind to how problematic it is at day 0.","commentId":"72d6478a-025e-43e4-ab33-6919b08e8aff","parentId":"35e54acb-58e4-4b3c-80b8-0567d381df9f"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"35e54acb-58e4-4b3c-80b8-0567d381df9f:undefined","_id":"vfuPLp1Ed36O55dH"}

But the reality we experience is subjective, whether we hear laurel or yanny, whether the dress is blue or gold. What we see, what we hear, what we taste, it all gets subconsciously pre-processed before it reaches out conscious mind. To tie into another HN article from yesterday, an expensive bottle of wine does taste better to us, even if it&#x27;s exactly the same wine inside. The objective reality is that it&#x27;s the same wine, but our subjective reality, from what we see, from what we taste, is that the expensive bottle is a fine wine.<p>Plato recognised this when he penned the Allegory of the Cave (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Allegory_of_the_Cave\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Allegory_of_the_Cave</a>)<p>I&#x27;ve started to apply this realisation to life in general.

So often in this day and age, people have a set opinion and think that if you disagree you&#x27;re a bad person, or being deliberately wrong or lying.<p>As much as I hate to wade into the Trump debate and American politics, this has been one of the failures of the left in the USA.

However, it meant that the use of functions like `exec` and `del` were no longer permitted since we would not be able to statically determine all scope elements at run time (consider `exec(input())`, this could introduce anything into scope and we can&#x27;t track that).<p>If you know, how does CPython resolve scope if it maps variable names to indices? In the case of `exec(input())` and say the input string is `x = 1`, how would it compile bytecode to allocate space for x and index into the value? I don&#x27;t have much experience with the CPython source, so please excuse me if the question seems naive :)!<p>&gt; 2. Where do you actually make useful use of Rust&#x27;s static ownership system? I&#x27;ve only skimmed that part of the thesis very quickly, but I missed how you track ownership in Python programs and can be sure that things don&#x27;t escape. Can you give an example of a Python program using dynamic allocation that your compiler maps to Rust with purely static ownership tracking and freeing of the memory when it&#x27;s no longer used?<p>Elements of the Value enum (that encapsulates all types) relied on `Rc` and `RefCell` to defer borrow checking to run time. Consider a function who has a local variable that instantiates some object. Once that function call has finished Cannoli will pop that local scope table and all mappings will be dropped when it goes out of scope. The object encapsulated in a `Rc` will have it&#x27;s reference count decremented to 0 and be freed.<p>This is how I&#x27;ve interpreted the Rust borrow checker, I will say that this was the first time I had ever used Rust so it&#x27;s possible that I am not completely right on this. But once that table goes out of scope, all elements should be dropped by the borrow checker and any Rc should be decremented&#x2F;dropped.<p>&gt; 3. Related to 2: Why bother with any notion of ownership at all? Did you try mapping everything to Rust&#x27;s reference counting and just letting it do its best? I&#x27;m wondering how much slower that would be. Python is also reference counted, after all, and I guess the Rust compiler should have more opportunities to optimize reference counting operations.<p>I did defer a lot of borrow checking to run time with Rc, but I tried to use this as little as possible to maximize optimizations that may result from static borrow checking.<p>&gt; 4. In general, do you have an idea why your code is slower than Python, besides the hash table variable lookup issue I mentioned above?<p>If you remove the 3 outlier benchmarks (that are slow because of Rust printing and a suboptimal implementation of slices), Cannoli isn&#x27;t too far off from CPython. And in fact, with the ray casting benchmark, Cannoli began to outperform CPython at scale. This leads me to believe that the computations in Cannoli are faster than CPython. However, there is still a lot of work to do to create a more performant version of Cannoli. The compiler itself was only developed for ~4 months, I have no doubt that more development time would yield a better results.<p>That being said, I think the biggest slowdown comes from features of Rust that might not have been utilized. This is just speculation, but I think the use of lifetimes could benefit the compiled code a lot. I also think there may be more elegant solutions to some of the translations (e.g. slices), that could provide speedup. But I can&#x27;t say that there is one thing causing the slowdown, and profiling the benchmarks (excluding the outliers) support that.","commentId":"3803af6f-21c4-4f12-b3dc-0eb5994baa91","parentId":"02ee3260-1982-4801-9d14-d1216795f61b"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"7605667c-de3a-495b-a14a-684f7c8db6a8:undefined","_id":"xTTiSVN19l1nuBYI"}

Deleting old content, deleting likes and whatnot.<p>I would have likely stayed on the platform if there was an easy way to do this. One of my biggest concerns wasn&#x27;t just Facebook analysing my data, but allowing others to access it indiscriminately and I wanted a way to delete it.<p>There&#x27;s no API functionality to delete&#x2F;untag&#x2F;unlike anything. Timeline is a mess, there&#x27;s no bulk delete option or option to even select multiple&#x2F;all. No &quot;delete after X days&quot; feature. In the end I spent 3x12 hour shifts writing a python script using image processing to find delete buttons in timeline and go through the motions to delete everything. It took about 3 hours for me to write&#x2F;debug&#x2F;test 300 lines of spaghetti python and another 30 or so for it to go through everything and try to delete. All of which should have been doable in &lt;30 lines, a single API call, or by just hitting ctrl+a and delete. I deleted my account afterwards mainly out of spite.<p>Considering how politicians are already getting stung by things they posted to FB&#x2F;Twitter in their teens here in the UK it is absolutely incomprehensible to me how Facebook doesn&#x27;t have half decent delete functionality.","commentId":"9c36cc9a-c384-41c7-9f08-134350a0c3d8","parentId":"0fc6ca9a-ce9e-4c7d-b207-2d1dac411a8d"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"8f140ef1-9004-4324-adb5-352c3939568f:undefined","_id":"zbUwcZvqyToRhOCz"}

Even in the face of the local government (I live in the UK) that have kept fighting for positions I find abhorrent (e.g. UK governments keep complaining about having to abide by EU human rights regulations for example).<p>Yes, we shouldn&#x27;t aim to give governments power to push things to an extreme, but on the other hand we should also ensure that they have the ability to actually react to serious abuses.<p>In particularly in the area of data protection, I don&#x27;t know of a single example where the rules have been pushed to the extreme. If anything, as a private citizen I&#x27;m disappointed there&#x27;s not been stricter enforcement. As someone who has had to deal with it on the corporate side as well, it&#x27;s not been hard to comply with.<p>Enforcement here is generally always strongly predicated on not jumping straight to the strictest possible outcome, but in carefully considering how serious a transgression is. It&#x27;s not that EU systems are inherently good, but that history and practice have shown that when they give flexibility, it takes serious abuses and ill intent to end up with the strictest reactions allowed, and there&#x27;d also be little reason to assume that anyone rushing to the strictest interpretations possible wouldn&#x27;t get shut down hard by the courts.","commentId":"771c925b-e46c-4b80-9532-7812f2da2844","parentId":"ab7e39ed-d7eb-4974-a1fe-56df0fa5fb49"},"aggregateIdAndVersion":"0666631e-2d24-478a-a90f-266984e59c7c:undefined","_id":"zw2z57PXubmeg9Dn"}
