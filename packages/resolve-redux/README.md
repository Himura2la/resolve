### `createViewModelsReducer`

  Generates a standard Redux reducer using reSolve view models. This function takes the following arguments:

```js
createViewModelsReducer(viewModels)
```

### `createReadModelsReducer`

  Generates a standard Redux reducer using reSolve read models. This function takes the following arguments:

```js
createReadModelsReducer(readModels)
```

### `createJwtReducer`

  Generates a standard Redux reducer using reSolve JWT. This function  does not take any arguments:

```js
createJwtReducer()
```
  
### `createResolveMiddleware`
  
  Redux middleware used to:

  1) Automatically fetch a view/read model state and subscribe to events.
  2) Send a command to the server side.
  
```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers } from 'redux'
import { routerReducer, routerMiddleware } from 'react-router-redux'
import {
  createViewModelsReducer,
  createReadModelsReducer,
  createJwtReducer,
  createResolveMiddleware
} from 'resolve-redux'

const resolveMiddleware = createResolveMiddleware()

const store = createStore(
  combineReducers({
    ...reducers,
    router: routerReducer,
    viewModels: createViewModelsReducer(viewModels),
    readModels: createReadModelsReducer(readModels),
    jwt: createJwtReducer()
  }),
  initialState,
  applyMiddleware(
    routerMiddleware(history),
    resolveMiddleware,
    ...middlewares
  )
)

resolveMiddleware.run({
  store,
  viewModels,
  readModels,
  aggregates,
  origin,
  rootPath,
  subscribeAdapter,
  sessionId,
  isClient
})
```

### `connectViewModel`
  A higher-order component (HOC), which automatically subscribes/unsubscribes to/from a view model by aggregateIds and fetch a view model state.

```js
import { connect } from 'react-redux'
import { connectViewModel } from 'resolve-redux'
import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux'

const MyComponent = () => { /* React component implementation */ }

const mapStateToOptions = (state, ownProps) => ({
  viewModelName,
  aggregateIds
})

const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
  items: ownProps.data
})

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) =>
  bindActionCreators(aggregateActions, dispatch)

export default connectViewModel(mapStateToOptions)(
  connect(
    mapStateToProps,
    mapDispatchToProps
  )(MyComponent)
)
```

### `connectReadModel`
  A higher-order component (HOC), which automatically subscribes/unsubscribes to/from a read model by resolver name and resolver arguments and fetch a read model state.

```js
import { connect } from 'react-redux'
import { connectReadModel } from 'resolve-redux'
import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux'

const MyComponent = () => { /* React component implementation */ }

const mapStateToOptions = (state, ownProps) => {
  return {
    readModelName: 'Items',
    resolverName: 'getAllItems',
    resolverArgs: {  },
    isReactive: true
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => {
  return {
    items: ownProps.data,
  }
}

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) =>
  bindActionCreators(aggregateActions, dispatch)

export default connectReadModel(mapStateToOptions)(
  connect(
    mapStateToProps,
    mapDispatchToProps
  )(MyComponent)
)
```

### `createActions`

  Generates Redux actions using a reSolve aggregate. This function uses the reSolve's [`sendCommandRequest`](#sendcommandrequest) action to pass a command from Redux to the server side. Generated actions are named as an aggregate's commands. This function takes two arguments:
  * `aggregate` -  reSolve aggregate
  * `extendActions` - actions to extend or redefine resulting actions
